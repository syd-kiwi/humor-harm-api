I keep that and whatever doesn't get a laugh, I work on until it gets, you know, ah-ha-ha. 15 plus years ago, my friend Ivan, who is one of my, he's my number one longest, oldest employee, not old like he's like, hello, how are you? He's just, he's been around a long time. He's been there from day one. Ivan's original job was to record my shows using a camcorder. Now the fact that I'm saying camcorder should be an indication of the timeline because I know some of you right now are like, what's a camcorder? Yeah, so it was a Snapchat of our day. So Ivan would record the shows and then put away the camcorder and the tripod and a bunch of tapes into a bag. It was very bulky. It wasn't a phone, it was bulky.

And Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. Well President Trump has just now been well established. Is the greatest negotiator, the greatest deal maker, the greatest diplomat, and the greatest peacemaker that we have ever seen in this country. Well it was a very tough decision. All the nominees delivered extraordinary tongue work this week but only one can win. And the Golden Graveler goes to... LARLA TRUMP LARLA TRUMP LARA TRUMP Congratulations LARA. You are the bootlicking brown nose, suck up sycophant, apple-polishing, gonad-guzzling ass kisser of the week.

I brought my wife, then fiance's family, on a trip to Mexico. There's like this really touristy beach that you can only access via boats. They've got like water slide and zipline and you lounge on the beach and hammocks over the water. The boat this time, for whatever reason, was leaving from a military port. And so as we're all getting in line to go on the boat, we're going through metal detectors. I'm like, that's stupid. We're going, why? Why? I forgot that I always have a little weed pen or CBD pen on me. This one was specifically my CBD pen for chronic pain. I honestly didn't even realize I had brought it to Mexico. It was just in the bottom of my backpack stored away. They pull it out and it's got a little THC on it. It helps the uploading of this CBD. It helps my brain upload. I'm f***ed. And Maggie's mom, she's like trying to talk to them in Spanish, being like, it's a misunderstanding. And I'm like, you guys got to get the f*** out of here. Just go. They told me I was very lucky because had this been like two years ago, this would have been a fang. But the result of this was just, you're not getting on this boat today.

It's called landslide, landslide times two, but 97, 94, 95, 96% of the people are against me in the sense of the newscasts are against me. The stories are 90, they said 97% bad. You see what we have here, people? 2,600 counties, minus 525 counties divided by negative 97. I think you see what this all adds up to. See, I think that's really illegal personally. Boom! Let me explain something. Free speech has always been a ratio. If the county vote were more equal, you could take a good story and make it bad without being jailed. But as our founders stated in the Constitution, when the delta between the sigma of counties divided by factorials of negativity are greater than pi, your inalienable rights turn into more of a expired groupon.",2026-01-27T23:11:59.632721Z,s3://humor-harm-dataset/dataset-s3/0qOZ6XTklPc.mp4

And she's like, oh my goodness, this is so exciting. Then she doesn't hear from him the next day, and like, for a few weeks, he's like dodging her calls and stuff.

Surrogacy was and is an incredible medical advancement, but there is a portion of the industry that has become this commercialization of childbearing and that is what I take issue with. Where wealthy couples can just rent wombs from women who need the money, where children are literally ripped away from their mothers the second that they're born.

It's not sitting well because Shane Dawson is infamously known for saying absolutely abhorrent comments about children.

The death rate was over 3,000 people per million populations. We are 200 times the death rate of countries that were essentially unvaccinated. Did COVID save millions of lives? As I said, he got Americans back to work. At that time, that particular vaccine was perfectly matched to the virus that was circulating then. And I have no idea how many lives it saved, but it saved quite a few. For every one life they saved from COVID, they're killing four people from the vaccine. This is the deadliest vaccine ever made.

At first I was really happy about helping people in psychology, but through experiential learning, I've learned that if they don't want to help themselves, I'm pretty much useless, so I have no clue how my job's going to be. My classes? They're actually pretty easy so far. I just learned about a guy named Sigmund Freud, and apparently he's like the Christopher Columbus of psychology. I've come to realize in society, we know nothing about psychology. At this point, my classes are just the same as last semester, but phrased a little differently in harder exams. I just love that my major is completely dependent on which field I go into. Obviously, if I work for a school, I'm not going to make that much, but if I have my own practice, I can make a few hundred thousand a year.

Look, I'm of two minds about this thing, because it is clearly a distraction, so I don't want to spend too much time on it. But I'm of two minds about this thing, because one, obviously there's a world where he's just saying stuff to say stuff, to swiftly move the news cycle in another direction, and he may not do anything. But the fact, as a sitting president, that he would even move the news cycle that he would even muster up the corner of his thumbs to put that into a phone to go out to the world is so deeply insane, because this thing that he's doing now is not just a step too far. It's the entire field too far. Rosie O'Donnell is an American citizen, a citizen. And so if he can do that, then truly, truly 100% without a doubt now, nobody is safe.",,s3://humor-harm-dataset/dataset-s3/dWLdBvd_unQ.mp4

For more than 35 years, Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a bitter conflict that resulted in tremendous suffering for both nations. They suffered gravely for so many years. With this accord, we've finally succeeded in making peace, and we just left the Oval Office, where we signed voluminous documents and very important elements to the agreement. The country of Armenian, Azerbaijan are committing to stop all fighting forever, open up commerce, travel and diplomatic relations, and respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Actually, we are writing a new history in bilateral interstate relationship between the United States and Azerbaijan. We are starting the path towards strategic partnership. The Chata on Strategic Partnership will be elaborated within several months, and that is a historic achievement for Azerbaijan, because to be in the format of strategic partnership with the greatest country of the world is a great opportunity and also a very big responsibility. Today, we have reached a significant milestone in Armenia-Azerbaijan relations. We are laying a foundation to write a better story than the one we had in the past. This breakthrough would simply not have been possible without President Trump's personal engagement and his resolute commitment to peace in our region. The initialing of peace agreement will pave the way to end the decades of conflict between our countries and open a new era based on the full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other.",,s3://humor-harm-dataset/dataset-s3/ddOti18SvVI.mp4

And he sidelined the pro-life wing of his party. He has changed the party for sure. Okay. So he believes abortion should be legal for 12 weeks. But free trade, you meant for. On foreign intervention, he's anti-war. He's trying to bring it to an end to all of these wars, okay? By surrendering, but yet. Okay. And he's not free trade. He does not believe in free trade. He looked at our destroyed manufacturing base. He looked at the downwardly mobile working class. He looked at the fact that working class Americans can no longer afford the American dream. And he looked at why that was, which was there was a handshake agreement between both parties that we should somehow have free trade, which resulted in shipping 5 million good manufacturing jobs overseas to build up China and Mexico. And some came here. No, what they did was they brought in millions and millions of illegal migrants to compete with the jobs that remained here.

,,,,,,1567,,,,,,,"I work from home, but my family yelled at me for being lazy and told me to leave with my dog. I decided to do it, but since the house was mine, I sold it. What happened next? It was so funny. My brother Dan moved in last year after his divorce. Said he needed a place to crash for a few months while he got back on his feet. I felt bad for him, so I said yes. Big mistake. Then my mom started coming over every single day to cover him and do his laundry. Then his girlfriend Hailey moved in without even asking. Suddenly my quiet house turned into complete chaos. One morning I'm on a video call with a major client in California. Presenting a project I'd been working on for three months. Dan bursts into my office in his boxers and a stained t-shirt. Can you keep it down? I'm trying to sleep. It was 10 a.m. on a Tuesday. I muted myself quickly and whispered through clenched teeth. I'm working. This is literally my job, my career. Yeah, playing on the computer all day. Must be real tough. Must be nice. He said loudly. And slammed the door so hard, my diploma fell off the wall. My client heard everything. I had to apologize profusely. I was completely mortified. My mom overhears from the kitchen where she's making Dan breakfast and comes barging into his defense. Kathy, you're always on that computer making noise at all hours. Your brother works hard and needs his rest. Maybe you should get a real job with normal hours like everyone else. I'm a senior software developer making over six figures a year. But apparently that doesn't count as real work. It got progressively worse every single week. They started throwing parties on weeknights with Dan's friends. Having loud family dinners in my dining room with random people I'd never even met. My dog Rex would bark at all the strangers and I'd get complaints from clients during important calls. Daily redecorated my entire living room without asking permission. Said my style was depressing and outdated. Dan ate all my groceries every week and never once replaced anything. Mom gave them my master bedroom because they're a couple and need more space than you. I was literally sleeping on my own couch in my own house. The final straw came when I checked my credit card statement. Dan had somehow gotten my card information and charged $3,000 for a new TV and sound system. I completely snapped. You all need to leave right now. This is my house and I'm done being disrespected. Dan actually laughed in my face. Your house? Mom said Grandma left it to the whole family when she died. We have just as much right to be here as you do. Hailey crossed her arms and smirked. Besides, where would we even go? You'd really kick out your own brother onto the streets? That's pretty cold. Mom started crying those manipulative tears. How can you be so selfish and cruel? We're family. Family is supposed to help each other in hard times. Your grandmother would be so disappointed in you. That's when I calmly walked to my office and came back with a folder I'd been keeping safe. I pulled out the deed and all the property documents. Just my name on every single page. Not Dan's, not Mom's, mine. Grandma knew exactly who she could trust with her house. You have exactly 30 days to leave. I sat as calmly as I could manage. Dan's face went completely pale. Hailey started yelling about tenant rights and illegal eviction. Mom called me heartless and said I was abandoning family over petty pride and bitterness. For the next month, they made my life absolutely hell. Broke dishes and furniture intentionally. Let Rex escape outside twice and I had to search the entire neighborhood frantically for hours. Told all our relatives I was kicking them out for absolutely no reason and painted me as the villain. The day after they finally left, still calling me names, a real estate developer called me. She'd been watching the neighborhood closely and wanted to make an offer. The area was getting gentrified really fast. I sold it for $200,000 over the original asking price. Cash offer. Bought a gorgeous condo across town with floor to ceiling windows, a 24 hour doorman, and a huge dog park where Rex immediately made friends. Got a dedicated home office with a door that actually locks and soundproof walls. My productivity doubled within weeks. Landed three new major clients. Last week, Dan texted out of nowhere. Hey sis, having a rough month, can you spot me rent? Just $1,200. I'll pay you back soon, I promise. I sent him a photo of me and Rex on our new balcony overlooking the city skyline at sunset. Added a caption, sorry, spent all my money on this amazing view. Then I blocked his number permanently. Mom called from Dan's phone 10 minutes later. You've changed. Money and success have made you cruel and heartless. I said no. Boundaries and self-respect made me happy and hung up. Best decision of my entire life.",,s3://humor-harm-dataset/dataset-s3/f8CVatqM4B8.mp4

He approached it with empathy and, you know, it was supposed to make people feel bad for Ethan. He needs a hug. No, he just needs a hug. He needs a good ass whooping is what he needs. He approached it with empathy. So like, first of all, just on face value, this is a pathetically insane take. And it's just part of this continued gaslight campaign to make it feel like I'm imagining I'm imagining people coming after me and my family. And this is part of it. She's like, don't you realize we were being nice to you? But this ignores the empirical fact that she and everyone else is ignoring, which is that Dr. Kirk said explicitly on video, which I can pull up, that Ian's initial first draft was him changing my grade. And when he said he wouldn't change my grade, he had to scramble to make a new ending, which is when he reached out to everyone to say something nice about me. This was not his intention setting out making this video. It was literally a plan B. That's the truth. And it's on video. I quickly apologize. If I had known that the whole video was concluding on me changing the grade, I still would have refused to change my grade, but I would have done it in a much more careful way. Because I thought that he was just experimenting with different elements of the content copy. I thought I was going to be one of hundreds of possible things that he would put in. And I thought, since I didn't change the grade, I wouldn't even make it in the video. And I asked him about it actually today. And he said that he thought I was going to change the grade. And that when I didn't change the grade, he had to completely rewrite the ending, the epilogue. That sounds pretty genuine, guys. That sounds like a really genuine effort to make me just make people sympathetic with me. To that hour long content cop video. And he had to and maybe influenced to make it more positive. And then he reached out to all those content providers for them to all say something nice in light of what I had done. Yeah, pretty fucked up, huh, Dr. Kirk? Yeah, it's pretty insane.

You're doing that in Tescos, you just go in, in Tescos, Alsatians everywhere ready to eat your face, well the French are all right with that apparently, and the fields all around that supermarket there are just migrant camps. The main road is just a caravan of illegal immigrants. And the French have got so used to it, that it seems that they just accept it. Do we want that to happen here in Britain?

The DOJ has seized over $700 million of Maduro-linked assets, including two private jets, nine vehicles and more. Yet Maduro's reign of terror continues. He is one of the largest narco traffickers in the world and a threat to our national security. It's the most significant escalation of tensions between the two countries. And now in battle with Venezuelan leader, Nicolas Maduro says he's preparing for an invasion and imploring citizens to fight off a potential US attack. I am enlisting because I love my homeland. Join with your family, join with your community, enlist and join the ranks. Long live Venezuela. The call to arms is a way to rally support in his country, exhausted after years of economic decline and political strife. We defend our people and we, one way or another, are going to defend ourselves. But even as he claims to have more than four million soldiers, police and militia members ready to do battle, Maduro may be outgunned. The Trump administration has sent at least three US Navy destroyers, a submarine, attack aircraft and 4,000 Marines to stem the flow of drugs to the US, which they say Maduro is responsible for. Maduro denies any role in drug trafficking, but he is under federal indictment in New York for allegedly running a shadowy cartel of army officers turned drug lords.

I'm not so sure about the First Amendment, the cornerstone of the Constitution. Even the Second Amendment extremists talk about the First and Second Amendment.

Trump is also making it clear that speech is more important when it is speech loyal to Trump. But when they don't agree with Trump, it's a problem.

Everyone's adrenaline kicked into overdrive as my teacher let out a battle cry. Choose a bus garage! Running for our literal lives as my twig body tried to keep up. We made it to the safe haven, which felt like a horror movie. But hey, at least we were surrounded by school buses. You know, if things went south, we had like 15 escape vehicles or 15 ways to run the guy over. Depends how you look at it. We all huddled in silence for hours and I was convinced I was gonna die in a freaking bus garage. I try not to make a single peep. Shh! Relax kid, I'm your principal. Anyways, what are you guys doing here? The lockdown ended hours ago. Oh, it looks like my walking, talking disconnected. Bro, bro, I risked my life over a bad connection.",,s3://humor-harm-dataset/dataset-s3/L06dg1E277o.mp4

This is a little white as shit, dawg. Oh, yeah. My. How you doing with white men? You OK? I'm good, man. I'm good, man. Can I get some hand sanitizer or something? I don't know.
