My dad cheated on my mom today and kicked him out of the house, but I'm here for you, mom.
What are you talking about? It's cheat day. He went to go buy cookies. My stepmom's name is cookies?
I can't do much.
Have us pray.
Hey, we need to pray.
I ought to pray.
Hey, babe. Would you still love me if I was fat?
Yeah, of course.
But mom, you are fat.
How old are you?
I'm 80. I'm 83.
Eight and a three.
And you're almost one hundred.
That's right.
And then you're gonna be there.
Eli!
I hope so.
No.
Just give me my money.
I said, come, nigga.
Come, nigga.
