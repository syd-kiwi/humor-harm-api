1,"Imagine Bill Maher being the voice of reason for the left. This sad news, we found out this week that Sydney Sweeney is... That was just... Uh, no, she's not. But you all see the ad that she's out there. This is a very important ad that we're seeing now. There she is, dressed like Jay Leno in all blue denim. And she talks about the fact that she has blue eyes, and then she says, I have great jeans, you know, because she's wearing jeans. But according to the woke people, this means that she's a white supremacist. They should have been aware when they wrote this ad that this is what some people were gonna think. I don't think they did it on purpose, but I also think it's pretty funny that all the online social justice girls are like, it's racist, there's no such thing as good jeans.

2,"I've always been an animal lover. Ever since I saw a picture of a dog, I've been like, I want that. I still love and respect animals, but as a kid, it was pretty intense. Not gonna lie. Can we get a dog? Can we get a dog? Can we get a dog? My parents had to sit through years of that until my dad finally couldn't handle it anymore and got me one for my seventh birthday against my mom's will. Before that, they tried everything to make me stop, besides getting me a dog. And by everything, I mean a bunch of fish. Maybe if we shape these fish into a dog, she won't notice. They'd come home with two fish from the pet store that would last for about a week, die, and then get replaced. Repeat until dog appears. How many fish must die before I get what I want? Since we got fish from the pet store and not an actual breeder, that was probably a big contributing factor on why they died so quickly. But as a five-year-old, I also just forgot to feed them a lot, so there's gotta be some fish blood on my hands for that.",,Not Humor,None of these,Other,None of these,No,,,XDuGBcv_R80,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDuGBcv_R80,Her Parents Hated DOGS?!?! 😳 #jaidenanimations #animations #cartoons #funny #meme #skit #lol,Her Parents Hated DOGS?!?! 😳 #jaidenanimations #animations #cartoons #funny #meme #skit #lol,,GlamourTV-1,UCW-4jz8O0yTKWNYx6lsI9tQ,GlamourTV-1,@GlamourTV-1,20250609,58,55179,,7,People & Blogs,en,Keyword_JaidenAnimationsfunny

Son, you want my personal opinion or you just want to buy it and be done with? No. Please tell me if I'm making a mistake. Is a 22 a good gun or a bad gun? Son, in my personal opinion, you're better off tickling them, as far as I'm concerned. All you're gonna do is aggravate the situation. You're just gonna piss him off is what I'm trying to tell you. Well Jim, listen to my thought process. My whole idea for the gun is I'm gonna use the gun more so like as a deterrent. So if somebody breaks into the house, they're gonna see this big bald Mexican holding a gun and then they're gonna think twice and then rob my neighbors instead. Son, if somebody breaks into your house and they have a gun, they're gonna know you're holding a .22 and I'll tell you what's gonna happen. They're gonna take it from you and they're gonna beat the holy hell out of you with it.

9,We just saved Mr. Beast from going blind. It comes at a surprise that Mr. Beast was about to lose his eyesight until fans online noticed something off about him. When Mr. Beast would smile his eyes wouldn't move which looked incredibly creepy. Mr. Beast took notice of this and got his eyes checked by a very special doctor. The eye doctor was blown away by what he saw. What's crazy is how earlier this year Mr. Beast cured 1000 people from blindness but little did he know he was suffering himself. The doctor noticed he had severe astigmatism where up close and far was blurry. This shocked Jimmy as he always thought it was normal to not be able to see clear far away.

Bulletproof, the wedding singer, the water boy, Big Daddy. But in between all this, he made a movie that's arguably the best comedy he ever made. And a lot's happened to him since then. He made his wife on the set of Big Daddy. He formed his own production company, had some kids, got some serious acting roles that he gave Oscar-worthy performances to, and then out of nowhere, he told us this. People have been asking for a long time, do Happy Gilmore 2, and I was always like, nah, I'll only let you down. But then me and my buddy Tim Hurley, we came up with the idea, we're really excited about it.

16,"The number one question I've got when it comes to my shows is, what is your writing process? My writing process is simple. I do not sit and write out jokes. I am really bad at that. Ask the Oscars. I experience things and then I come out on stage and I share them and sometimes people laugh and if they laugh, that's cool. I keep that and whatever doesn't get a laugh, I work on until it gets, you know, ah-ha-ha. 15 plus years ago, my friend Ivan, who is one of my, he's my number one longest, oldest employee, not old like he's like, hello, how are you? He's just, he's been around a long time. He's been there from day one. Ivan's original job was to record my shows using a camcorder. Now the fact that I'm saying camcorder should be an indication of the timeline because I know some of you right now are like, what's a camcorder? Yeah, so it was a Snapchat of our day. So Ivan would record the shows and then put away the camcorder and the tripod and a bunch of tapes into a bag. It was very bulky. It wasn't a phone, it was bulky.

In The Ridiculous 6 (2015), the six brothers stumble upon the most bizarre barbershop in the Wild West—
and it’s WAY more than just a haircut. 💈🪒🤣

At first glance, it looks like your typical old-timey Western barber shop…
But once inside, they realize—

This place does EVERYTHING. 🪥🩺💊

💈 Need a shave? Sure.
😬 Toothache? No problem—they’ll yank it out right after the beard trim.
💉 Feeling itchy? They’ve got ointments for that too!
🐴 Even your horse’s cracked hoof? Yep—the same cream works for that. 🐎💥

The sign on the wall proudly reads:

“Haircuts, tooth pulling, foot washing, rash treatment, hemorrhoid cure, exorcisms, AND financial blessings. One-stop service!” 🤣🙌✨

The brothers stand there, completely stunned.
“Wait… what kind of shop is this?!” 🤯

But in the world of The Ridiculous 6, the more ridiculous it gets, the funnier it becomes.
It’s not just a barbershop—
It’s a Western-era all-in-one life service center. 😂💈🩹🐴

In a time when medicine was guesswork and barber chairs doubled as dentist chairs,
this scene perfectly captures the wild, chaotic charm of the frontier. 🌵🎩

The West wasn’t just wild—it was downright absurd.
And that’s exactly why we love it. 🤠🤣

Cole Palmer scored two brilliant goals and laid on a third for Joao Pedro in a truly incredible first-half performance against the European champions.

After Chelsea celebrated the win US President Donald Trump and Fifa President Gianni Infantino came onto the pitch to hand out the medals.

Trump and Infantino were then tasked with handing over the first ever Club World Cup trophy to Reece James.

The English full back was all ready to lift up the award with his teammates but Trump didn’t leave the stage.

James even appeared to ask him at one point if he was going to move out the way but a gleeful Trump simply smiled at him.

It took a slightly worried Infantino to come and rescue the US leader from the celebrations.

There's like this really touristy beach that you can only access via boats. They've got like water slide and zipline and you lounge on the beach and hammocks over the water. The boat this time, for whatever reason, was leaving from a military port. And so as we're all getting in line to go on the boat, we're going through metal detectors. I'm like, that's stupid. We're going, why? Why? I forgot that I always have a little weed pen or CBD pen on me. This one was specifically my CBD pen for chronic pain. I honestly didn't even realize I had brought it to Mexico. It was just in the bottom of my backpack stored away. They pull it out and it's got a little THC on it. It helps the uploading of this CBD. It helps my brain upload. I'm f***ed. And Maggie's mom, she's like trying to talk to them in Spanish, being like, it's a misunderstanding. And I'm like, you guys got to get the f*** out of here.

724,"So, okay, Newsom is lobbing the unfathomable accusation that Trump might make decisions without fully thinking them through, but I'm sure Trump will be the bigger man here. Earlier in the day, the president suggesting that it might be a good idea, his borders are Tom Homan arrested the California governor. I was doing it to go with Tom, I think it's great. When asked what crime Newsom has committed to warrant arrest, the president responding. I think his primary crime is running for governor because he's done such a bad job. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. That's a ridiculous statement from Trump. Gavin Newsom's primary crime is obviously his podcast.

725,"Look, the president has always maintained that he would implement sanctions on Russia when he felt it was appropriate and necessary. And yesterday was that day. I think the president has also long expressed his frustration with Vladimir Putin and, frankly, both sides of this war. And he's always said, in order to negotiate a good peace deal, both sides need to be interested in a good peace deal. And he feels as though, unfortunately, from the Russian side as of late, he has not seen enough interest and enough action in terms of moving the ball forward towards peace. And so a meeting between these two leaders is not completely off the table. I think the president and the entire administration hopes that one day that can happen again. But we want to make sure that there's a tangible, positive outcome out of that meeting and that it's a good use of the president's time. Of course, he's traveling to Asia next week.

So record deportations, that doesn't matter for anything. Record deportations are the majority of which are voluntary. Who cares? They're going. The point is we have to move them. I care.

About Anjelah:
Anjelah Johnson-Reyes was born and raised in San Jose, California where she grew up with four siblings in a large extended family to which she remains close. Anjelah found herself an internet sensation and pioneer in viral YouTube videos when her notorious “Nail Salon” bit from a local comedy show was posted and received over 100 million views! Shortly thereafter she was added to the cast on the original MADtv where she trademarked her legendary character, Bon Qui Qui. Similar to the nail salon video, the Bon Qui Qui sketch caught on and have been viewed by over 75 million people. The multi-hyphenate’s popularity has translated into four successful comedy specials: That’s How We Do It” (Comedy Central), The Homecoming Show (NUVO TV), Not Fancy (Netflix) and Mahalo & Good Night (Epix). She has displayed her acting prowess both on TV and film. Some of her credits include “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Superstore,” “Moms’ Night Out,” and “Alvin & the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.”  Her first book was published in 2022, Who Do I Think I Am: Stories of Chola Wishes and Caviar Dreams, a hilarious and touching memoir full of memorable anecdotes on how a Latina dynamo was able to forge ahead and become successful.

For several days in July, these two kingdoms in Southeast Asia engaged in deadly fighting. The Thai and Cambodian militaries battled each other across stretches of their long, contested border, killing dozens and displacing some 200,000 people. Cambodia fired rockets while a tie of 16s carried out airstrikes. It was the worst violence between these two countries in generations. In late July, a lull in the fighting, after Trump declared, amid threats of imposing high tariffs, that Cambodia and Thailand agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a ceasefire and ultimately peace. The next day, with the help of U.S. mediation, Cambodia's Prime Minister met his Thai counterpart in Malaysia to agree to a temporary ceasefire.

910,"But fart face was those two guys, Josh Brolin's character who I think his name is Jim Deaver, saying, we think you're a fart face. Hello, fart face. Hello. So we did it at dress rehearsal, and this happened to be the show that Sarah Palin came to. At that time, the highest rated SNL episode in the history of the show. We did it at dress, it played absolute silence. Right. That awful feeling where you go, and you can hear it. And Lauren Michaels, I don't know why, took a real shine to it, and he had somehow moved it up in the order. It was right after update. And the weekend update was Sarah Palin rapping with Amy Poehler, and the audience was so hot, and me and Brolin and him were dressed as these characters knowing this is gonna bomb. And I remember we went there, and we were sitting there looking at the audience, and then Josh Brolin just turned to us and goes, well, fellas, let's shut these fuckers up. Have to cry face.

913,"So there was a 15 pound baby born. And I want it. A 15 pound two ounce baby in California and he is a candidate for the state's largest baby. And possibly one of the nation's largest in recent memory. Baby's name is who cares. So his mother's only five foot one and she delivered him via C-section obviously because she would be dead. That's a great thing about having a baby that big because you literally lose all the baby weight when the baby, because the baby's all of the weight and he has the weight on him. So you don't have to lose additional weight. That's all the fucking weight. Like a big one. Chewy, how big were you when I birthed you? How big were you? Do you remember?

918,"asked earlier about Fallon and Seth Meyers but is the president's view that they should also be taken off the air shared by the FCC? Well, yeah, I don't speak for the president. So obviously, you know, he speaks for himself on that. Our goal and our obligation here is to make sure that broadcasters are serving the public interest and if there's local TV stations that don't think that running that programming does it then they have every right under the law in their contracts to Preemptive and we'll see how this plays out. But I do think that again, we are in the midst of a massive shift in dynamics in the media Ecosystem for lots of reasons. Will you only be pleased when none of these comedians have a show on broadcast television? No, it's not about any particular show or any particular person. It's just we're in the midst of a very disruptive moment right now. And I just frankly expect that we're going to continue to see Changes in the media ecosystem. Think about the madness of all of this. Again, you've got now the Magorite being champions of cancel culture. You've got the Magorite now trying to crush free speech after being supposed free speech absolutists. You have Pam Bondi talking about going after a Home Depot if they won't print out Flyers certain political flyers maybe arrest them Talking about the fire me and again The idea that squads of people are going around and saying don't worry Charlie We're going to find people who used free speech in a way you wouldn't have liked and get them fired from their jobs Are you kidding me? Right. Are you kidding me? This is the very thing that he and the magam movement and the free press Is that what we're complaining about for a decade? And now they're taking it in a more extreme way Than the left ever did. I mean again, they've cancelled two of three late night show hosts In a short period of time And now they're threatening retribution For people who won't print out flyers the threatening retribution for people that put out a mean tweet I mean We've made it very clear We've made it very clear before that that that um Political violence is heinous that against Charlie Kirk Was absolutely just vile and heinous and and that's why we saw most sides Strongly and roundly condemning that Violence Yeah But the fact that they're actually doing the opposite of what Charlie Kirk talked about in his campus tours Says all you need to know about these people",,Not Humor,None of these,Other,None of these,,,,68hTieVyP30,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68hTieVyP30,‘Are you kidding me?’: Joe calls out MAGA for ‘trying to crush free speech’,"ABC’s decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel off the air sparked backlash from Hollywood to Washington, with critics calling it a free speech crisis.

919,"You guys remember the sister squad? More importantly, these two. It was Grayson and Ethan Dolan, James Charles and Emma Chamberlain, and Emma just dropped the T on Ethan. Long story short, when you watch their videos, you knew there was something going on, and Emma broke it down. So she basically said that her and Ethan were friends, and when they'd hang out, they eventually started hooking up. No guy ever had this type of hold on her. Like, all she thought about was him. But really, let's be honest, like Grayson Dolan was the better Dolan twin, in my opinion, but they kept it super casual. Then one day, Ethan is like, I want to be exclusive with you. And she's like, oh my goodness, this is so exciting. Then she doesn't hear from him the next day, and like, for a few weeks, he's like dodging her calls and stuff. Then when he finally gets on the phone with her, he's saying that he doesn't want to be exclusive anymore. They continue to hook up, but then she finds out that he's seeing other people on the side. She's like, what the heck? This is a super short version, but then moving forward after they kind of like, break things off, he texts her saying, hey, she throws her phone at the wall, cause she's just like, so upset. But she wants to text him, but then her dad's like, no, don't do it. And then when she threw her phone at the wall, she realized this is not healthy. The fact that she's thriving shows that she made the right decision. I still think Grayson Dolan is a better Dolan twin. The way she explained it is a lot better. There's like a podcast on YouTube, but the sister squad was just so entertaining, and Ethan just dropped the ball. Again, this is a super short version, but I thought it was interesting how she literally spilled all the tea.",,Not Humor,None of these,Celebrity and pop culture,None of these,,,,6B3a5gTDeWc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B3a5gTDeWc,Ethan Dolan broke Emma Chamberlain's heart 💔,"I'm on here weekly, sometimes more than once!

927,"Our entire school went into lockdown and it was crazy. We were on lockdown for over an hour and most people were just locked in their classrooms, but I was in P. The entire time this sound was playing, which was honestly just really creepy and it's ingrained into my brain. And a teacher also had to take roll to make sure everyone was there, lock all the doors, and eventually take all of our phones. One of the kids in my class even made a bad joke and told his mom that one of our classmates got hit with a pew pew. And then he had to give up his phone so he couldn't respond to any of the messages his mom sent him. So I imagine she was extremely worried. But nobody knew if there was actually a threat on our campus or not, because there was rumors that there's somebody with a pew pew in one of the classrooms. And the students in our ag building, which is a little bit off campus, ran away. And also after hearing this, a kid in wood shop grabbed an axe and started running around campus trying to find the threat. One of the kids in my class snuck out to a room where there was a window. And he said he saw the entire street and parking lot just filled with cops, sheriff's swat, and literally every law enforcement in our area.

935,"How did you get the job, by the way, on Silicon Valley? It was pretty crazy. I graduated UCSD. I was an economics major, because that's the easiest major that would still please a foreign parent. So I was about to graduate, and I didn't know what I wanted to do. I just know I didn't want to do economics. And so when I was graduating, I was just totally lost. And my commencement speaker happened to be Mike Judge. He was talking about how he graduated as a physics major, but he hated his job in the 80s in Silicon Valley. So he ended up finding his passion in comedy and animation. So I didn't know I was going to go on a stand-up or acting. And eventually five years later, Mike, who didn't even know I was sitting in the audience that day in the commencement speech, he was the one that gave me the big break. Wow. That was a sweet full circle right there. So now that you're on the show, now do your parents get it? Now do they think you're funny? No. My dad would say, no.

Though the protests were triggered by the social media ban, there has been widespread frustration with the government over the perceived lack of action to tackle corruption. Thousands took to the streets on Tuesday, even as a curfew was put in place after 19 people were killed in clashes between police and protesters on Monday. At least two more people were killed on Tuesday.

Oli took over as Prime Minister in July 2024, his fourth time in office, with the backing of the Nepali Congress Party.

The unrest is the worst in decades for the Himalayan nation.

971,"You know, like many black men my age, the first time I voted was eight years ago. I saw Obama on TV and said, oh, I'm voting for this. I remember the day I voted for Obama. I voted in Ohio. And my vote matters in Ohio. Ohio is a battleground state. But when I pulled up through the polls, all the soldiers were in line. There were so many black people in that goddamn line, I didn't even know it was a poll. I thought it was a check-hashing place. We were hugging each other and old people were singing hymns and spirituals and sh**. It was like the O.J. verdict times, 10 or something. I've never seen black people that had happened. Eight years later, I'm pulling up to the polls again. This time I'm driving a brand new Porsche because the Obama years were very good to me. And when I parked my car, I figured out something that would take the rest of the country another week to figure out. I understood that Donald Trump was going to be our next president because in Ohio, unlike D.C., you could see the results in the parking lot. So all these goddamn pickup trucks and tractors and sh**. And then I walked up and I saw a long, long line of dusty white people. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, these were the poor whites. Now, let's tell you, I've never had a problem with white people ever in my life, but full disclosure, the poor whites are my least favorites. I've never seen so many of them up close. I looked them right in their cold smeared faces. And to my surprise, I didn't see one deplorable face in that group. I saw some angry faces and some determined faces, but they felt like decent folk. No, they did. In fact, I'm not even lying and I didn't sound f**ked up, but I felt sorry for them. I know the game now. I know that rich white people call poor white people trash. And the only reason I know that is because I made so much money last year, the rich whites told me they saved at a cocktail park. And I'm not with that. And I still with them in line, like all of us Americans are required to do in a democracy. Nobody skips the line to vote. And I listened to them. I listened to them say naive, poor white people things. Man, Donald Trump's gonna go to Washington and he's gonna fight for us. I'm standing there thinking to my mind, you dumb mother f**ker.

The crunch is so loud you can't hear your parents arguing in the front seat over who's gonna get custody or not. You know in Asia, parents don't argue. Just hit you with a slipper. American parents are worse, they hit you mentally. They'll say stuff like, I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. See, it's like the Olympic logo, but fatter. This potato chip I get from T-Mobile. What does this mean? Chip factory. Everything made in factory. I'll hold her in the cage. Six. They have this little tray in there for you. Smaller. Is everything smaller in?

And one bedroom apartment is going to be $1,600. She spends $100 on utilities. She's like me. She drives a 2008 minivan. $400 for a car, expenses, and gas. Net 325. Low-cost food budget. That is ramen, noodles. A low food budget is $400. That leaves her $77 in the red. She has a cricket cell phone, the cheapest cell phone she can get for $40. She's in the red $117 a month. She is after school childcare because the bank is open during normal business hours. That's $450 a month. That takes her down to negative $567 per month. How should she manage this budget shortfall while she's working full time at your bank? I don't know that all your numbers are accurate. She's short $567. What would you suggest she do? See if you can find a way for her to live on less than the minimum that I've described. I don't know. I'd have to think about that. Mr. Diamond, you know how to spend $31 million a year in salary.

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

Don't worry, its name comes from the French word for fish. If you don't know about Cartana, this is about to blow your mind. Gage box it through what the hell made this note. Once again, I cut a worthless object. Sir Skits another iconic one. Ah. Soul Rock sounds like a dude doing this. Let's enjoy a little Quagsire. To me, B.E.M sounds specifically like Grover.

1166,"Today we're talking about a very dark topic. We're talking about the infamous YouTuber Shane Dawson. Shane Dawson and his husband, Ryland Adams, just had two baby boys via surrogacy. Cause you know, they're rich and they can rent a couple of wombs. Surrogacy was and is an incredible medical advancement, but there is a portion of the industry that has become this commercialization of childbearing and that is what I take issue with. Where wealthy couples can just rent wombs from women who need the money, where children are literally ripped away from their mothers the second that they're born. But in the case of Shane Dawson and his husband, I have a deeper issue because of Shane's history. It's not sitting well because Shane Dawson is infamously known for saying absolutely abhorrent comments about children. None of this is natural or biological, but it's also borderline scary that anyone who writes a fat check can do this without much thought. Let's just read this tweet. Shane Dawson is a celebrity who openly justified, admitted that he searched for childbearing and called it sex-disgusting. I see somebody who is utterly depraved, who has lost all sense of right and wrong and simply has no morals.",,,,,,,,,DivfIbRT5hI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DivfIbRT5hI,Brett Cooper SHOCKED By Shane Dawson Becoming a Father,,,BrettCooperFanPage,UC94a4nLjcExg8PquSF4LvVQ,BrettCooperFanPage,@BrettCooperHighlights,20241118,60,512719,28076,1000,People & Blogs,en,Keyword_ShaneDawsonTVfunny

1197,"This is the difference between jail and prison. As part of your plea deal, would you like to spend your time in prison or jail? I don't know, what's the difference? Well, first there's comfort. Jail cells are only meant to hold people for a year or less, so they usually come with cheap, low quality bedding. Here's your blanket. What the? This is a wet towel. A prison cell on the other hand is designed for long term living, sometimes for life. So they generally have higher quality bedding and a small window for natural light. Well, if that's the only difference, then I'm going to prison. Well, there's another difference, privacy. What do you mean? Prisons have far more guards than jails because prisons hold some of the most dangerous criminals in the world. This also means there's video surveillance watching you 24 hours a day. Oh, well you put it like that, I guess. And then there's the freedoms. Freedoms? In jail, there's often nothing to do while you wait. But in prison, there's usually an exercise yard, a basketball court, and even a TV room. Hey guys, the latest law by Mike video just released. Let's subscribe to that guy. Man, this is tough. I know, I'll pick neither. Nice try.",,,,,,,,,EjAHseZEJwI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjAHseZEJwI,Jail Vs Prison - What's The Difference?,"Difference Between Jail And Prison!

1298,"I sometimes, when I go out on stage, I'm like, oh my God, I'm gonna talk about my kids so much, like younger generations, they're just gonna tune me out. Do you feel like you don't have that problem? Well, I have a young Gen Z assistant and she really keeps me in tune with what's cool and what's not cool. And so I feel like I get a good vibe from her. It's so fun to have a young person around just to check the references they know and don't know. I think we get mad at young people sometimes about what they don't know, but we're really just mad that they're younger than us and they're gonna be in a coffin less soon in their skin site, but we can't really admit that. We can't really admit that. And so we just say things like, you've never seen the Goonies? It's like, why would they? She was in 10 in 1991. You know who Sigourney Weaver is? Oh, come on. It's like, what? But it happened to us too. Like there's always someone that's incredulous about what you don't know of like, you know who Buddy Capshaw was? From the Horton's Comedy Hour? His famous line, who stole my cat fit? Like there's always something that you don't know, but it is really funny. Like some of the things she's messed up, we were talking about, me and my openers, we were talking about Nirvana. And we just checked in with her. We go, you know Nirvana, right? And she goes, duh, the T-shirt company? And so, but why wouldn't she think that? It's just a T-shirt she's seen. And then- There's just three guys who started a T-shirt company. And they were like, we should be on all their shirts. And then we were talking about George W. Bush. And she was like, I know him. And we're like, good, okay. What's like the, who's the most famous person he is related to? And she was like, stop, this is easy, Jenna. And so, I like how the Gen Z was like, duh, yeah. His dad was also president.

There's a policy in the United States called Launch On Warning. The president must make a counter-attack decision before those nukes land. A strike with a one-megaton thermonuclear weapon against Washington, DC, that was two million people. 82 nuclear weapons could possibly obliterate their nuclear command and control. Russia was so paranoid that the United States was gonna launch a preemptive nuclear attack against it. They created a system whereby ground sensors would be able to determine nuclear bombs hitting the Russian soil. And if they weren't hearing from the nuclear command and control, the dead hand system would launch all of Russia's remaining nuclear weapons without even needing a hand to push the button.

1311,"India's capital is in Delhi, this video is viral Pollution station was running water from government trucks near it People were shocked by the huge reaction In reality, pollution is at 1000 levels And it will be 400 because dust will be suppressed Then, Delhi government said, Government said, Hey, you idiot, this is not your home laptop which will change the data from one truck to another Then people said, There is a point, what will change from one truck? Government said, The official machines which are used to read pollution are tamper proof It can't be shaken by sparkling water And the truck that is visible to settle the normal dust is the truck Okay, let's agree on the government's point But Supreme Court said one day The day of pollution was on the day of Dipawali Out of the 37 air stations in Delhi, only 9 were on, the rest were off Supreme Court asked, why is this happening? There are so many departments in the government And in this, what is the work that thousands of government ministers do every month? In the Indian state, it reached 400-500 average levels How many departments are there? Central Pollution Control Board Commission for Air Quality Management Ministry of Environment 1000 departments are open for names And I don't know why this exists Like, Subscribe, definitely",,,,,,,,,ImPZAoWWBdY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImPZAoWWBdY,BRO… Delhi Is Literally ‘Washing’ The AIR - So Much Pollution! #shorts,"Recently in Delhi, a controversy broke out over the city government’s handling of air pollution data. Videos circulated online showing water being sprayed around air-quality monitoring stations in certain parts of the city, especially near areas like Anand Vihar. This led to allegations that the Delhi government was trying to artificially lower pollution readings by wetting the ground around the sensors. The idea behind the claim is that spraying water can temporarily reduce dust and particulate matter in the air, which might make the air quality appear better than it actually is.

People who made these allegations pointed out that only the areas around the monitoring stations were being sprayed, while nearby roads and open spaces, which also contribute to pollution, were left untreated. They argued that this selective watering could make the air-quality data look more favorable, misleading both the public and policymakers about the true level of pollution in the city.

The Delhi government, however, denied any wrongdoing. Officials said that the sprinkling of water was part of routine anti-pollution efforts meant to reduce dust in heavily polluted zones. They also stated that the air-quality monitoring systems are automated and cannot be manually tampered with. According to them, the timing of water-spraying near the stations was coincidental and not an attempt to manipulate data.

This incident has raised questions about transparency and trust in how air pollution is being managed in Delhi. While spraying water is a legitimate method to control dust, doing it selectively near sensors can create doubts about the integrity of the data. Many people believe that a more transparent approach, with clear reporting on when and where such activities take place, is necessary to maintain public confidence and ensure that pollution-control efforts are genuinely helping improve air quality, not just improving the numbers.

1317,"Emma Chamberlain has the internet sobbing after what happened the other day. Here's the whole lore in less than 60 seconds. Basically the truth about Emma and Ethan came out because in 2018 they all made youtube videos together. Dolan twins James Charles and Emma and they caught it the sister squad. And through that time Emma and Ethan were always flirting, always hugging on each other and it just looked really suspicious. But they were never seeing people thought. Anyway Emma finally came out and spoke on the whole situation just recently like three days ago. But yeah in the podcast she basically talks about how Ethan literally took advantage of her, played with her feelings, to the point that when they broke up she literally said that she didn't want to be here and that she wanted to unalive herself. He then goes on to talk about the reason it hurt so much is because she legitimately thought her and Ethan were soulmates. And then he said he needed a break and essentially ghosted her and got with another girl. But all in all Emma says she's doing way better and that the whole situation taught her some big lessons.",,,,,,,,,Ix1Ia3h1BRc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1Ia3h1BRc,Emma chamberlain has fans in tears #emmachamberlain #tiktok #shorts,,,kai lanier,UCQMg1wnPRT4adw3fU9qz97g,kai lanier,@kailanier,20250106,47,24090,984,7,Entertainment,en,Keyword_EmmaChamberlainfunny

1347,"I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries, and never even received a phone call from the United Nations, offering to help in finalizing the deal. All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up stopped right in the middle, then a teleprompter that didn't work, repaid kindness with crime. It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now. Let's see, I can tell you. I'm really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell. I've also been working relentlessly, stopping the killing in Ukraine. I thought that would be of the seven wars that I stopped. I thought that would be the easiest because of my relationship with President Putin, which had always been a good one. In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal, to end the war then, the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs, which would stop the bloodshed, I believe, very quickly. But for those tariffs to be effective, European nations, all of you are gathered here right now, would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures. I mean, you're much closer to this. We have an ocean in between. You're right there. And Europe has to step it up. They can't be doing what they're doing. They're buying oil and gas from Russia while they're fighting Russia. I've also been deeply engaged in seeking a ceasefire in Gaza. Some of this body is seeking to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. The rewards would be too great for Hamas terrorists, for their atrocities. This would be a reward for these horrible atrocities. Release the hostages now. It's climate change.

Trump made the surprise announcement during a regional tour that began in Saudi Arabia. The White House indicated a meeting between the president and Sharaa — a former al Qaeda commander who spent five years in a U.S. prison in Iraq — would take place May 14.

1367,"Hey, I'm Andrew and I'm a psychology major. Hey, I'm Cory. You look sad. Have you ever thought about getting medicated? If so, I know a guy. I chose psychology because I think the human mind is really interesting. My favorite show right now is actually True Crime because I like seeing the reason behind people's decisions. At first I was really happy about helping people in psychology, but through experiential learning, I've learned that if they don't want to help themselves, I'm pretty much useless, so I have no clue how my job's going to be. My classes? They're actually pretty easy so far. I just learned about a guy named Sigmund Freud, and apparently he's like the Christopher Columbus of psychology. I've come to realize in society, we know nothing about psychology. At this point, my classes are just the same as last semester, but phrased a little differently in harder exams. I just love that my major is completely dependent on which field I go into. Obviously, if I work for a school, I'm not going to make that much, but if I have my own practice, I can make a few hundred thousand a year. I've come to realize if I want to make some real money, I'm going to need a master's or even a doctorate degree, but hey, who doesn't want to be in school for eight more years? While I haven't had any real, intelligent experience back in high school, I did help my friends with a break-up, and it was a great feeling. Hey, did your mom happen to die when you were little? No. I'm just getting this feeling that something really drastic happened in your life. You know, your mom's probably about to die, but if you ever need any help, I'm here for you, and in the future, I can maybe even prescribe you some medicine.

Maybe we should thank the producers for all their input. I suppose. I still got it. Talking to the producer, he's had his little... Oh, he is. When Stephen Hawking came up, he had his little nose power joint. Which, to be honest, is the least of his problems. He's usually the best one in the room. LAUGHTER Don't worry, you're just the same as Stephen Hawking. Look at that, all the clever stuff. Although he milked it a bit, didn't he? He's a genius. I don't have it ready. I don't have it.

Too much, it got embarrassing, to be honest. That won a lot of individual awards. But this is for writing. No, on a serious note, this is for writing because I can speak for Stephen as well. We are proudest of my writing. LAUGHTER I knew he'd agree with me. And the thing is, the other thing about writing is it's not paid as well. I've earned about, what, 10, 20 times what you've earned? LAUGHTER Really? I mean, again, that's embarrassing. LAUGHTER And even in the industry, it's not looked upon as important. I've never seen Alan Yen-Tob run across a crowded room to hug a writer.

Wait, what? Uh, what? I wanted to make those fucking episodes live so everyone can see. You know, you came here, that doesn't make me violate the restraining order, okay? Wait, wait, please let me explain. You see, we had a running joke on the podcast that we'd filmed several episodes with Markiplier that were too awkward, uncomfortable, or even criminal to air. Except we'd never actually met him. So when our podcast was ending, we reached out to see if he'd come on for the first time, pretend he'd been on before, and hated all of our guts. We weren't expecting to get any response. But then he said yes and he was really into it. We're like a heart attack or something. I've had one before. Real one? Yeah. You had a heart attack? Yeah. Why? Come on, I'm gonna ask my heart. I don't know. He is a great actor and that's the most uncomfortable I've ever been in my life.

The two leaders were greeted by an array of questions from media.

A major subject in the UK has been censorship and free speech. Trump dribbled with the question for a second before passing it off to Starmer, who dismissed any controversy around the hot topic.

1417,"So attack on Titan and code GYAS, tie at number one for me. And then number two, it's probably gotta go to an OG. It's probably gotta be like Dragon Ball just because of like the cultural impact that had that changed the game. Number three is a full blown toss up. I might give number three to something like a jujutsu kaizen cause I think it's like the best shounen. Why, what about you? Are you big weed from Otaku? Not really. My favorite show ever, and this is weird, but I'm like, I wouldn't ever put anime over regular shows.",,,,,,,,,b2-HxMIcR2g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2-HxMIcR2g,"Top 3 Anime Series  Attack on Titan, Code Geass, a #funnymoments #penguinz0 #moistcr1tikal","CaseOh is back with another hilarious edit!

1419,"You've pissed the b***h. First time I stayed with Jane at her parents. It was early days like we've been going up for about a year and we went back to her parents house and then her parents were out or away. So we were in their bed, we were staying in their place. And we went to a party and I got pissed and apparently at the party I was lying on the dance floor trying to trip people over. So we went back, went to bed. Obviously I got up in the middle of the night, not knowing where I was, walked around the bed thinking I was in the toilet and started pissing. That was quite a lot I think. Jane goes, Ricky! And I went, bloody waking me up. Fantastic. Yeah, so yeah. Have you pissed a lot of b***h then?",,,,,,,,,b6_xbwff0Y4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6_xbwff0Y4,Ricky Gervais has Noel Gallagher in Stitches over Hilarious wetting the bed Story!!😂😱,"🎬 Welcome to Comedywave! 🌊

Ali Siddiq is a stand-up comedian, public speaker, and writer out of Houston. Ali’s unique style of stand-up began behind the walls of incarceration, an incubator for interesting experiences and good stories.  
 
People received their first taste of Ali Siddiq when he appeared on HBO's DEF COMEDY JAM and LIVE FROM GOTHAM, and in 2013 he was named Comedy Central's ""#1 Comic to Watch"".  In 2014, Ali impressed comedy enthusiasts by displaying his ability to captivate an audience with his ""Mexicans Got On Boots"" tale, descriptive storytelling, with over 15 million views, of a prison riot on THIS IS NOT HAPPENING, the first of three appearances.  His stories continued with his HALF HOUR special, which premiered on Comedy Central in the fall of 2016.  Immediately following the premiere of that special, Comedy Central offered Ali an hour-special where he performed for inmates live in a Texas jail, sending Ali back to where it all started. The hour special, Ali Siddiq: It’s Bigger Than These Bars, premiered in February 2018 on Comedy Central.  In 2019, Ali could be seen as a Top 5 finalist on NBC’s BRING THE FUNNY. Most recently, Ali could be seen as a guest on THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE.

1494,"Hey, what's a wealth gap? Uh, exactly what it sounds like. Can you measure it in this country? Absolutely. Total household wealth is a little over $18 trillion, which per person on average $654,000. What the f***? Who's got all the money? Hey, boys. Hey, Dad. How much wealth do baby boomers have? Depends how you measure it. Against global and historical averages? Well, in that case, a real lot. How come? We're mainly housing. The house prices have gone up a lot, but also super. Our retirement savings have benefited from a big boom in the share market. Ah. But older people are helping younger people. What do you mean? 20% of households are giving money to family members, and that's a record high. Most of the money is actually for day-to-day living expenses. So hang on. Older people have enjoyed an unprecedented wealth boom, and younger people are needing help just to live, and they're increasingly relying on their parents' generosity for that help? Yeah, but only some families can provide the help. 20%. The richest 20% of them. The other 80% can't do it. That is a wealth gap. You guys seem sad. Want some money? Yes, please. Yes, please. I actually think this might be your tie. Yeah, it looks like it.

And he came out, he heard about this. Man didn't even put on a tie. Came out of the White House, half dressed, ran straight into reporters, and he went into it. He was like, I heard about what Iran is doing and what Israel is doing. And let me tell you, I'm angry at Iran, but I'm more angry at Israel. They said peace, and I said, we're going to do peace, and they're launching. And I'm sick of them. Israel, you better not do. You don't do it, Israel. I said peace. You don't do it. He looked like a dad who had kids that were fighting in the backyard. And he was just going back and forth. He's like, Israel, shut up, baby. Come on, shut up. Shitter, how many times do I have to tell you, kids, that you're not going to? I tell you once, and I'll tell you again. And then he looked at the reporter, and he did something I've never seen an American president do in my entire life. He cursed live on TV, into the camera. Looked at the camera, and he was like, they were like, what do you think, Mr. He's like, I'll tell you what this is.

1507,"It's simply the case that modern politics takes often people who are quite impressive before they went into politics. Saja Javed, Ben Wallace, John Major, some ex-entries are may. These are people who, if you met them working for a company or they were in the charity you worked for, you'd think were really impressive. Soon as you put them in politics, something weird happens and I think they've identified a lot of the reasons why it's weird. It is partly to do with party whipping, it's partly to do with the way in which people do political communication, the sort of obsession on tribal loyalty, working it to the other side. It's also the weird way that social media works, the way that we clip people, the incredible polarization, the lack of trust and politics.

[""The World's Best in the World""] [""The World's Best in the World""] On any other day in American history, that would be a headline. Any other day that would be wild. And look, Rosie O'Donnell and Donald Trump have what I think is now a 20-year feud going on, which is absolutely insane. The president of the United States has the ultimate and deepest beef. His arch-nemesis is the actress from Harry at the Spide. That is mind-boggling. The leader of the free world is ready to have it out at any given moment with the voice actors from the man gorilla in the Disney movie Tarzan. The man with his fingers on the button for the nukes has a deep hatred in his heart decades long. For Nickelodeon Kids Choice Award winner Rosie O'Donnell, this is an unacceptable timeline. I don't even know what Rosie O'Donnell did that day. Like, I don't know what even brought it up, but he says, you know, I'm thinking about revoking Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship. If Ireland wants to keep her, they could have her. And any other day, this would be the story. He knows that. Who knows? Look, I'm of two minds about this thing, because it is clearly a distraction, so I don't want to spend too much time on it. But I'm of two minds about this thing, because one, obviously there's a world where he's just saying stuff to say stuff, to swiftly move the news cycle in another direction, and he may not do anything. But the fact, as a sitting president, that he would even move the news cycle that he would even muster up the corner of his thumbs to put that into a phone to go out to the world is so deeply insane, because this thing that he's doing now is not just a step too far. It's the entire field too far. Rosie O'Donnell is an American citizen, a citizen.

For more than 35 years, Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a bitter conflict that resulted in tremendous suffering for both nations. They suffered gravely for so many years. With this accord, we've finally succeeded in making peace, and we just left the Oval Office, where we signed voluminous documents and very important elements to the agreement. The country of Armenian, Azerbaijan are committing to stop all fighting forever, open up commerce, travel and diplomatic relations, and respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Actually, we are writing a new history in bilateral interstate relationship between the United States and Azerbaijan. We are starting the path towards strategic partnership. The Chata on Strategic Partnership will be elaborated within several months, and that is a historic achievement for Azerbaijan, because to be in the format of strategic partnership with the greatest country of the world is a great opportunity and also a very big responsibility. Today, we have reached a significant milestone in Armenia-Azerbaijan relations. We are laying a foundation to write a better story than the one we had in the past. This breakthrough would simply not have been possible without President Trump's personal engagement and his resolute commitment to peace in our region.

I'm not sure who had a weirder 48 hours, me or the CEO of Tylenol. But I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human. And that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what it was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some, that felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both. This show is not important. What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this. The president of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke. Kimmel had the queest fired. He had no talent. But he had no ratings. Well, I do tonight. He tried his best to cancel me. Instead, he forced millions of people to watch the show.

I mean, I was never a Republican or a conservative. I was a leftist, and I am still a leftist. I'm just a MAGA leftist now because... That makes no sense. I look at what President Trump ran on and the agenda that he's enacting right now. He took a Republican party that was built on social conservatism, foreign interventions and wars, and free trade and free markets. And he basically took an axe to all of those. During the campaign, he said, look, I mean, he's pretty pro-gay. That's pretty obvious. He appointed the highest-ranking out gay person, Scott Bessent, our secretary of treasury, which is incredible. And he sidelined the pro-life wing of his party. He has changed the party for sure. Okay. So he believes abortion should be legal for 12 weeks. But free trade, you meant for. On foreign intervention, he's anti-war. He's trying to bring it to an end to all of these wars, okay? By surrendering, but yet. Okay. And he's not free trade. He does not believe in free trade. He looked at our destroyed manufacturing base. He looked at the downwardly mobile working class. He looked at the fact that working class Americans can no longer afford the American dream. And he looked at why that was, which was there was a handshake agreement between both parties that we should somehow have free trade, which resulted in shipping 5 million good manufacturing jobs overseas to build up China and Mexico. And some came here. No, what they did was they brought in millions and millions of illegal migrants to compete with the jobs that remained here. And what Donald Trump said was, we have to stop selling out the working class. That agenda that he laid out, socially moderate, anti-war and anti-free trade protectionist, that is a leftist agenda.

When people talk about the Holocaust, when people talk about the Holocaust, they talk about the tragedy and horror of six million Jewish lives being lost to the Nazi war machine. But they never mention the thousands of gypsies that were killed by the Nazis. No one ever wants to talk about that because no one ever wants to talk about the positives.

You pick up your motion tracker to see a small dot, blipping. As it gets closer, you start to panic, hide under something, and pray to whatever god will listen. And that's when it drops down. Towering over you at almost 10 feet tall, this creature uses every sense at its disposal to hunt you down. It can smell you, and it wants you. The alien doesn't move on any set path and instead just prowls the station and reacts to every little noise.

1567,"I work from home, but my family yelled at me for being lazy and told me to leave with my dog. I decided to do it, but since the house was mine, I sold it. What happened next? It was so funny. My brother Dan moved in last year after his divorce. Said he needed a place to crash for a few months while he got back on his feet. I felt bad for him, so I said yes. Big mistake. Then my mom started coming over every single day to cover him and do his laundry. Then his girlfriend Hailey moved in without even asking. Suddenly my quiet house turned into complete chaos. One morning I'm on a video call with a major client in California. Presenting a project I'd been working on for three months. Dan bursts into my office in his boxers and a stained t-shirt. Can you keep it down? I'm trying to sleep. It was 10 a.m. on a Tuesday. I muted myself quickly and whispered through clenched teeth. I'm working. This is literally my job, my career. Yeah, playing on the computer all day. Must be real tough. Must be nice. He said loudly. And slammed the door so hard, my diploma fell off the wall. My client heard everything. I had to apologize profusely. I was completely mortified. My mom overhears from the kitchen where she's making Dan breakfast and comes barging into his defense. Kathy, you're always on that computer making noise at all hours. Your brother works hard and needs his rest. Maybe you should get a real job with normal hours like everyone else. I'm a senior software developer making over six figures a year. But apparently that doesn't count as real work. It got progressively worse every single week. They started throwing parties on weeknights with Dan's friends. Having loud family dinners in my dining room with random people I'd never even met. My dog Rex would bark at all the strangers and I'd get complaints from clients during important calls. Daily redecorated my entire living room without asking permission. Said my style was depressing and outdated. Dan ate all my groceries every week and never once replaced anything. Mom gave them my master bedroom because they're a couple and need more space than you. I was literally sleeping on my own couch in my own house. The final straw came when I checked my credit card statement. Dan had somehow gotten my card information and charged $3,000 for a new TV and sound system. I completely snapped. You all need to leave right now. This is my house and I'm done being disrespected. Dan actually laughed in my face. Your house? Mom said Grandma left it to the whole family when she died. We have just as much right to be here as you do. Hailey crossed her arms and smirked. Besides, where would we even go? You'd really kick out your own brother onto the streets? That's pretty cold. Mom started crying those manipulative tears. How can you be so selfish and cruel? We're family. Family is supposed to help each other in hard times. Your grandmother would be so disappointed in you. That's when I calmly walked to my office and came back with a folder I'd been keeping safe. I pulled out the deed and all the property documents. Just my name on every single page. Not Dan's, not Mom's, mine. Grandma knew exactly who she could trust with her house. You have exactly 30 days to leave. I sat as calmly as I could manage. Dan's face went completely pale. Hailey started yelling about tenant rights and illegal eviction. Mom called me heartless and said I was abandoning family over petty pride and bitterness. For the next month, they made my life absolutely hell. Broke dishes and furniture intentionally. Let Rex escape outside twice and I had to search the entire neighborhood frantically for hours. Told all our relatives I was kicking them out for absolutely no reason and painted me as the villain. The day after they finally left, still calling me names, a real estate developer called me. She'd been watching the neighborhood closely and wanted to make an offer. The area was getting gentrified really fast. I sold it for $200,000 over the original asking price. Cash offer. Bought a gorgeous condo across town with floor to ceiling windows, a 24 hour doorman, and a huge dog park where Rex immediately made friends. Got a dedicated home office with a door that actually locks and soundproof walls. My productivity doubled within weeks. Landed three new major clients. Last week, Dan texted out of nowhere. Hey sis, having a rough month, can you spot me rent? Just $1,200. I'll pay you back soon, I promise. I sent him a photo of me and Rex on our new balcony overlooking the city skyline at sunset. Added a caption, sorry, spent all my money on this amazing view. Then I blocked his number permanently. Mom called from Dan's phone 10 minutes later. You've changed. Money and success have made you cruel and heartless. I said no. Boundaries and self-respect made me happy and hung up. Best decision of my entire life.",,,,,,,,,f8CVatqM4B8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8CVatqM4B8,"I work from home, but my family yelled at me for being lazy, and told me to leave with my dog...",,,TheRedditReader,UCrwlBJAIREbFMJkM5N_vObg,TheRedditReader,@TheRedditReader475,20251014,179,1468471,47526,278,People & Blogs,en-US,Keyword_funnyworkfromhome

1579,"Right, I am fucking sick and tired of the powers that be banning my fucking billboards and adverts for Dutch barns. Sometimes there's just nothing wrong with them, right? One that was meant for the tube station just had me having a drink and it just said one day you'll be underground for good. That was it. They went no, can't have that because it might make people think oh, because life's short we should drink to excess. Who's fucking thinking that? Oh my god. Cowardly fucking cunts. You think it's my attitude? Oh, but you can't win because, well, you're not allowed to say alcohol's good for you or it does this or it makes you feel confident or it makes you feel attractive, which is fine. I went the other way. There was one advert. I was reading from my laptop from government websites just saying about all the dangers of alcohol. They went no, we don't like we don't like that. Do you know why? Because they don't like the truth either because that puts off other advertisers. You know, fuck me, honestly. So this is what we're going to do. Fuck them. Okay, I'm going to sell directly to you. Go to the website, right? Sign up for our mailing list as well and you can win a year's supply of Dutch Barn. Also we save donkeys.

Born on June 25, 1961, in Reading, England, Gervais grew up in a working-class family, the youngest of four children. His upbringing deeply shaped his worldview and comedic sensibilities, grounding his humor in a blend of everyday realism, skepticism, and social commentary. Before achieving fame, he attended University College London, where he studied philosophy a subject that would later influence his reflections on human nature, morality, and the absurdities of modern life.

Gervais’s rise to international prominence began with 'The Office' (2001–2003), a groundbreaking mockumentary series that he co-created, co-wrote, directed, and starred in as the cringe-inducing yet oddly endearing David Brent. The show was an instant critical success, redefining television comedy with its deadpan tone, realistic documentary style, and unflinching portrayal of workplace monotony and human insecurity. 'The Office' became a global phenomenon, inspiring numerous international adaptations including the hugely successful American version starring Steve Carell. The show earned Gervais and co-creator Stephen Merchant widespread acclaim, including Golden Globes and BAFTA Awards, and cemented Gervais as a creative pioneer.

Following the success of 'The Office', Gervais continued to expand his creative range. He and Merchant collaborated again on 'Extras' (2005–2007), a series that explored fame, ego, and artistic integrity through the eyes of struggling actor Andy Millman. Known for its celebrity cameos and biting satire, 'Extras' further demonstrated Gervais’s talent for blending humor with pathos. He later ventured into stand-up comedy, where his style marked by bold social commentary, dark humor, and fearless candor garnered both praise and controversy. His specials, such as 'Animals', 'Humanity', and 'SuperNature', showcased his ability to provoke thought while making audiences laugh, tackling topics ranging from religion and fame to animal rights and political correctness.

Beyond television and stand-up, Gervais has made significant contributions to film and digital media. His roles in films like 'Ghost Town' (2008), 'The Invention of Lying' (2009), and 'Cemetery Junction' (2010) highlight his flair for combining comedy with emotional depth and philosophical insight. In recent years, his Netflix series 'After Life' (2019–2022) marked a creative and emotional turning point. The show, which explores grief, kindness, and the search for meaning after loss, resonated deeply with audiences and critics alike. Balancing dark humor with profound empathy, 'After Life' displayed a more mature and introspective side of Gervais’s artistry, earning widespread acclaim for its honesty and humanity.

Gervais is also well-known for his outspoken views and unfiltered public persona. As a frequent host of the Golden Globe Awards, he became notorious for his scathing monologues targeting Hollywood elites, celebrity culture, and hypocrisy within the entertainment industry. His fearless approach to comedy often walking the line between satire and offense has sparked debates about the limits of humor and free speech. Gervais himself has consistently defended the right to joke about any subject, arguing that comedy should challenge comfort zones and encourage critical thinking.

Beyond entertainment, Gervais is a passionate advocate for animal rights and humanitarian causes. He uses his platform to raise awareness about animal cruelty and environmental issues, supporting organizations such as PETA and the Humane Society. His outspoken advocacy reflects his personal values of empathy and integrity, qualities often mirrored in his work despite his acerbic comedic style.

Today, Ricky Gervais stands as a defining figure in modern comedy one who has reshaped the landscape of television, stand-up, and cultural discourse. Through his fearless humor, intellectual curiosity, and deep understanding of human vulnerability, he continues to challenge audiences to laugh, think, and question the world around them. Whether as a comedian, writer, actor, or social commentator, Gervais remains a rare figure who fuses irreverence with authenticity, leaving an enduring legacy in entertainment and beyond.",,Scum Deluxe,UCZCOlSMFaWJeroQZmTvAncw,Scum Deluxe,@scumdeluxe,20251102,85,2907385,124180,7300,Comedy,en-US,Keyword_funnycensorship

1598,"Well, I'd say there is I raised concerns about free speech in the United States of America. I think the entire collective West, the transatlantic relationship, our NATO allies, certainly the United States under the Biden administration, got a little too comfortable with censoring rather than engaging with a diverse ray of opinion. So that's been my view. Obviously, I've raised some criticism and concerns about our friends on this side of the Atlantic. But the thing that I'd say to the people of England or to anybody else, to David, is many of the things that I worry most about were happening in the United States from 2020 to 2024. I just don't want other countries to follow us down what I think was a very dark path under the Biden administration.",,,,,,,,,fvwC1551lGc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvwC1551lGc,Vance warns U.K. against censoring free speech,"Vice President JD Vance warned the UK and other European allies against the censorship he said was pervasive under the Biden Administration.

In fact, if you watch it live on television, like I did, when it happened, I thought it was fake. I did, and I wasn't sure. So you know what I did? I waited, because I'm like, I know Chris. I waited like 30, 40 minutes, as long as we're taking him to get to another party. And I called him on FaceTime and he picked up. As soon as he picked up, he said, he was the only nigga I had to answer the phone for. Apparently Obama and Oprah, everybody had called this nigga to see if everything was all right. And I thought it was fake. I didn't know. So I asked him when I go, I go, well, you know, he said, what? I said, did it hurt? And he said, yes, nigga, it hurt. And then I knew that it was real. And then, and only then, was I offended. And I wasn't just offended that he got slapped. That was only half of it.

I'm really sad. Well... Bleep. This is the same Donald Trump who openly called for vengeance against his political enemies. Now, thanks to the Supreme Court, there are no guard reels. Nothing to protect the people who are brave enough to speak out against him. And that is why we at SNL would like to say to Donald Trump, we have been with you all along.

I think I just witnessed the signing of a historic peace treaty on my front porch. My security camera captured this beautiful moment of diplomacy between two unlikely leaders. There was a gentle sniff, a gesture of peace, and then they both looked at the camera as if to say, ""The negotiations were a success."" I'm pretty sure my dog is now the ambassador for the entire neighborhood.
What do you think was the first article of their treaty? ""All leftover snacks shall be shared""? Let me know! 👇

1634,"Josh, what's your take on Trump's meeting with these African leaders? Ronnie, this was a meeting between Trump and a table full of Africans. This went as good as it could have gone. Trump didn't ask to touch anyone's hair. He didn't try to hit anyone with the... I was... I was pretty sure he was gonna say the phrase he's National Geographic titties. So compared to expectations, I would say that this one was one of his best performances. No, no, come on, he's the president. He told the leader of an English-speaking country he speaks great English. And he's right, he does speak English well. For once, he's not lying. Like, it's not like he told RFK Junior he speaks beautiful English. Like, that would be offensive, all right? It was a compliment. I compliment people's abilities speaking English all the time. You ever go to Florida and hear a complete sentence? That shit is impressive. Okay. Look, I don't know, man, I'm just saying, if that was me, I would have walked out. Yeah, that's... that's... cause you're Asian. What, what, what, are you saying Asians get offended easily? I'll f*** kill you. Chill, chill. Chill. I'm just saying black people have been through too much to get offended easily. Like, black people, we keep our cool, you know? We were brought here for slavery, but we didn't invent a jazz. The Liberian president knew that getting angry at Trump doesn't get you anything, but flattery does. If he was really smart, he would have said, oh, I learned English from watching your speeches, Mr. Trump. You're a real one. I call it Tesla too. Okay. Okay, fine, point taken, but, uh, what about that reporter though? That was kind of gross. Was it sexist? Yes. Did Trump act inappropriately? Yes. Did he come in his pants? Of course. All right?

That's clever, but the same can't be said for this next guy, because this criminal escaped by jumping straight through a window. Be right back. Here goes nothing. Surprisingly, this bold move actually worked and he evaded police capture. I can't believe I pulled that off. Neither could the police, but this next escape might even be more unbelievable. Richard McNair escaped prison again and ran into the woods, where he evaded police for hours. Eventually an officer finally found him and ordered him to stop. Oh, hey officer, just doing it for a marathon. Despite messing up his own name, the criminal convinced the officer he was just an innocent jogger. Yup, names Richard McPatty, nice to meet you.

1661,"Was it truly a pitch about a show about nothing when you actually pitched it? No, no, no, never. What was the original pitch like? The original pitch was how a comedian gets his material, which Larry and I knew we were lying when we said it, because nobody wants to see that. It's not interesting. But it sounds good to a network executive. Right. So they gave us a pilot. They didn't like the pilot. Everyone disliked it. And Rick Ludwin said, I'm going to take some money from Saturday Night Wrestling. In those days, professional wrestling replaced Saturday Night Live once a month. And he took the money from one of those, and it was enough money for us to make four episodes. They still didn't like it. And then Fox said, we want the show. And then NBC said, OK, we'll make a few more. They still wouldn't order it. They just didn't like it. When they put it after Cheers, we got ratings. And then they put us on Wednesday night. And again, we went in the toilet again. It was four years of struggle, which we didn't really care. We were just having fun doing the show. Button line. That's a genius button line, as I've ever heard. Is you delivering and you want to be my late tech salesman? Does that be your cashier? I'm telling you, your cashier got me that series. You think so? Yeah, that line. That line. The crush on that laugh was so big. I felt like a half back when you make the edge. And now I'm going upfield. That was one of the first or second episodes. And I was very uncomfortable acting. We were uncomfortable doing everything. We didn't know what we were doing. Larry and I learned to write stories, dialogue, scenes, act breaks, the whole racket. We didn't know anything.

See description.,"Updated Sep 12, 2025:
Back in the early days of the church, they would stone you for standing up for your beliefs.
Now, you can get shot.

.......

When the first martyr Stephen was stoned in Acts 7, he cried out:
""Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” (Acts 7:60, ESV)

I didn’t know Charlie Kirk personally — but based on what I’ve seen,
he grew in his faith during his public life and became quite respectful toward many (if not most?) of those who disagreed with him.

I want to believe, if he had the chance, he would have said the same thing Stephen did.
(And this is what I hope for my own attitude if I, dmh, am ever martyred someday):
""Father, don’t hold this sin against them.""

That’s the kind of man I want to believe Charlie was,
based on videos I’ve seen of how kindly he treated many of his haters.

.......

Charlie wasn’t perfect. He misspoke at times — as we humans tend to do.
He said controversial things — but controversial things are often true.

Example:

 The resurrection of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
= highly controversial AND true at the same time.



Charlie’s is the kind of courage and grace we need more of, in my opinion.
– dmh

.......

In an episode of Club Random (see my channel for 2 short clips), Charlie Kirk joins Bill Maher
for a wide-ranging conversation that aired on April 20, 2025.

At one point, Charlie and Bill briefly discuss the need for personal security —
a passing moment that now feels sobering in retrospect.

4 months and 21 days later, Charlie was shot and killed.

.......

Reports as of Sep 12 say the bullet casings at the scene were engraved with:

“Hey, fascist! CATCH!”

Lyrics from the anti-fascist song “Bella Ciao”

“If you read this, you are gay LMAO”

“Notices bulge, OWO what’s this?”


.......

Whether you agreed with Charlie or not,
this wasn’t just about politics —
it was about the cost of standing up for your beliefs
in an increasingly volatile culture.

.......

🙏 Pray for God's will to be done with justice for Charlie Kirk's family.

🕊️ May Charlie rest in peace.

🛐 May God comfort and protect his wife and kids.

God is a God of mercy,
but also a God of justice.

Don’t take freedom of speech for granted (preaching to myself)

Jesus is Lord.

🕊️ Be excellent to each other.

.......

An atheist-turned-preacher once said:

1. God loves you


2. God wants you


3. God made a way for you and me — & even murderers — to be with Him:
(The cross. Jesus is the way.)


4. The devil will do everything he can to keep you from believing the first 3.

.......

🙏 Want to Know How to Be Saved?

📖 The Bible teaches a simple but powerful pattern:


---

1. Hear the Gospel

“So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.”
— Romans 10:17 (ESV)




---

2. Believe in Jesus Christ

 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.”
— John 3:16 (ESV)



 “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.”
— Mark 16:16 (ESV)




---

3. Repent of Your Sins

 “The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.”
— Acts 17:30 (ESV)



 “Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out.”
— Acts 3:19 (ESV)



“Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”
— Acts 2:38 (ESV)




---

4. Confess Jesus as Lord

“Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”
— Romans 10:9 (ESV)



 “For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.”
— Romans 10:10 (ESV)



“Everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven.”
— Matthew 10:32 (ESV)


---

5. Be Baptized Into Christ

 “And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.”
— Acts 22:16 (ESV)



 “Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you—not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”
— 1 Peter 3:21 (ESV)



 “We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.”
— Romans 6:4 (ESV)




---

6. Live a Faithful Life

“Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.”
— Revelation 2:10 (ESV)



 “...not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another…”
— Hebrews 10:25 (ESV)



 “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.”
— 1 John 1:7 (ESV)

1680,"I think the content cop was great. You know, I feel like Ian approached it in a way that nobody else does. He approached it with empathy and, you know, it was supposed to make people feel bad for Ethan. He needs a hug. No, he just needs a hug. He needs a good ass whooping is what he needs. He approached it with empathy. So like, first of all, just on face value, this is a pathetically insane take. And it's just part of this continued gaslight campaign to make it feel like I'm imagining I'm imagining people coming after me and my family. And this is part of it. She's like, don't you realize we were being nice to you? But this ignores the empirical fact that she and everyone else is ignoring, which is that Dr. Kirk said explicitly on video, which I can pull up, that Ian's initial first draft was him changing my grade. And when he said he wouldn't change my grade, he had to scramble to make a new ending, which is when he reached out to everyone to say something nice about me. This was not his intention setting out making this video. It was literally a plan B. That's the truth. And it's on video. I quickly apologize. If I had known that the whole video was concluding on me changing the grade, I still would have refused to change my grade, but I would have done it in a much more careful way. Because I thought that he was just experimenting with different elements of the content copy. I thought I was going to be one of hundreds of possible things that he would put in. And I thought, since I didn't change the grade, I wouldn't even make it in the video. And I asked him about it actually today. And he said that he thought I was going to change the grade. And that when I didn't change the grade, he had to completely rewrite the ending, the epilogue. That sounds pretty genuine, guys. That sounds like a really genuine effort to make me just make people sympathetic with me. To that hour long content cop video. And he had to and maybe influenced to make it more positive. And then he reached out to all those content providers for them to all say something nice in light of what I had done. Yeah, pretty fucked up, huh, Dr. Kirk? Yeah, it's pretty insane. I feel bad for him. He's the one that got fucked the most in this, it seems like. Anywho. So yeah, that's my take on that whole ridiculous narrative.",,,,,,,,,j3c1fXJD91c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3c1fXJD91c,oh frogan...,"TEDDY FRESH...http://teddyfresh.com

And to live. It's been substantial. It's been great. No, I was down pretty low. I was down around 1990. I was minus $900 million. In fact, there's a very famous scene where I'm walking down the street with a very beautiful woman. And I said, do you see that man over there? She said, yes. Do you know who he is? Yes, he's a beggar. Isn't that too bad? I said, it is too bad. But right now he's worth $900 million more than I am. This is a bad point in my life. And she said somewhat naively, what do you mean, Donald? He's not worth $900 million, is he? And I said, let's assume he's worth nothing. But I'm worth minus $900 million. And so that was a low point. That was around 1991. And now the real estate markets have been booming in New York and elsewhere where I'm building.

1717,"One thing that stood out to me, and I want to really emphasise this, is what the local French population now consider to be normal as a result of the migrant crisis. Okay, so that was a major supermarket at a bus stop between Calais and Dunkirk. And what you saw in that 30 second snapshot there was migrants who had just been bussed in, they then go into the supermarket, they either steal or buy food and booze, there are police officers with just huge aggressive dogs just wandering around the supermarket. You're doing that in Tescos, you just go in, in Tescos, Alsatians everywhere ready to eat your face, well the French are all right with that apparently, and the fields all around that supermarket there are just migrant camps. The main road is just a caravan of illegal immigrants. And the French have got so used to it, that it seems that they just accept it. Do we want that to happen here in Britain?

1721,"Brian Kilmeade, Trump's buddy, and the Joey Tribbiani of Fox and Friends. He tried to gently push back when Trump started to blame the destruction of Ukraine on President Zelensky. You have a man who's led a country that had the most beautiful cities that demolished, had the most beautiful domes. Those domes are the most beautiful in the world. But that's Russia's fault, though, Mr. President. Russia did the impossible. They're all demolished, 1,000-year-old domes. And everything's demolished. But, Mr. President, that's what a repudence fault. Don't you agree? I get tired of listening to it. He makes it very hard to make deals. But look what's happened to his country. It's been demolished.

1725,"A smaller model of US Navy ships heads towards Venezuela. Its mission? To stem drugs sent from the South American country. The DOJ has seized over $700 million of Maduro-linked assets, including two private jets, nine vehicles and more. Yet Maduro's reign of terror continues. He is one of the largest narco traffickers in the world and a threat to our national security. It's the most significant escalation of tensions between the two countries. And now in battle with Venezuelan leader, Nicolas Maduro says he's preparing for an invasion and imploring citizens to fight off a potential US attack. I am enlisting because I love my homeland. Join with your family, join with your community, enlist and join the ranks. Long live Venezuela. The call to arms is a way to rally support in his country, exhausted after years of economic decline and political strife. We defend our people and we, one way or another, are going to defend ourselves. But even as he claims to have more than four million soldiers, police and militia members ready to do battle, Maduro may be outgunned. The Trump administration has sent at least three US Navy destroyers, a submarine, attack aircraft and 4,000 Marines to stem the flow of drugs to the US, which they say Maduro is responsible for. Maduro denies any role in drug trafficking, but he is under federal indictment in New York for allegedly running a shadowy cartel of army officers turned drug lords. Armed conflict may still be far from certain, but a showdown is brewing off the coast of Venezuela with neither side appearing to back down.",,,,,,,,,KYtgBQMWoiA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYtgBQMWoiA,Showdown looms off Venezuelan Coast,"A US Navy fleet is heading toward Venezuela in a major escalation aimed at curbing drug trafficking allegedly linked to President Nicolás Maduro.

1728,"I don't miss weed as much. I actually had to stop smoking weed before I stopped anything else because the weed, what happened, man? This shit got so strong, so fast. Like, do you guys remember old weed? Like, old weed was like silly, remember? You like smoke a little weed. You go to the store, you like get a bag of chips, you watch a movie. We used to giggle, man. What the fuck happened? Dude, I turned 25, I hit a joint one time. Dark thoughts, dude. Just questioning everything, just like, dude, am I a fucking loser? Dude, take this away. What the fuck is in that, man? Like the last time I ever smoked weed, I did a dab. Ooh, some trauma in the room. Yeah, if you don't know what dabs are, it's like a concentrated form of weed that doesn't need to exist, man. And I didn't know I was doing that shit because my buddy, he invited me over, this is what he said, he said, let's smoke weed. That's what the fuck he said to me. Let's smoke weed. I was like, hell yeah, dude, I love weed. I get to his house, first red flag. My buddy goes, hey man, you ready to smoke? And I'm like, let's do it. He goes, all right, I'm gonna go grab all the stuff. All the stuff. I was like, last I checked, we needed fire and an apple. What the fuck are you talking about? So I got to grab my rig, my glass, my wand, and my torch. He came back with a commercial grade blow torch, like, ready to smoke big dog? Psh. He's like, what the fuck is that for? You gonna weld us a bong? We have in creme brulee, what the? I'm not doing torch weed, bro. And immediately he got so sad. He was just like, oh dude, come on, you know? And I was like, okay. You drive a hard bargain. I was like, you light it, bro, I'll just fucking suck. You do your thing, I'll do mine. So I just put my mouth down like. Oh, is it working? Give me an update, man. And I just blow out this enormous milky cloud of smoke. And I just turn and look at my buddy, who's the biggest stoner I've ever known in my entire life. Says the worst thing you can hear out of a stoner's mouth. He just looks at me and goes, oh dude. That was a big hit, man. I was like, yeah! How big? He was like, oh, that was supposed to be for both of us. You cleared it, you cleared it. I was just like, oh, just immediate panic. We all know that moment. Just based off of the amount of smoke in the air and that little tickle in your throat, you're like, yep, the next four hours of my life are fucked. Because I just started walking towards the door, bro. I did not say goodbye. Kind of forgot how to walk a little bit, just trotting like a Clydesdale.

You know, like, they didn't believe me. And so, this one weekend, all right, I'm gonna tell you guys this, don't tell anybody the story, but this one weekend, went to this WrestleMania event with my dad, and he was partners with Hulk Hogan, right?

Do you guys know who that is? Okay. And it's another dude or whatever, right? So my dad gets into the ring, and immediately Roddy Roddy Piper flips my dad in a way, and he cracks my dad's ribs, right? So my dad has to go to the emergency room, right?

And then there's a knock at the door, and it was Roddy Roddy Piper, right? And he goes, AT, I'm real sorry about what happened, and Hulk Hogan's like, fuck that, and grabs Roddy Roddy Piper and brings him into the hotel room, throws him against the wall, smashes the mirror, they're beating him, my dad's trying to break it up, Hulk Hogan's wife, Linda's there, and she's like, Terry, stop, right? And I'm like, wow, I didn't know that was his name, right? So, and my mom is trying to make my dad stop, and they're just beating, and all this stuff is flipped over and shit like that, me and my sister are crying, and then we get on a plane, we come back to Chicago, I go to class, we're sitting and sharing circle, and the teacher's like, what'd you do this weekend?

1738,"If you thought Trump couldn't get more obvious about being an authoritarian, I've got news for you. He's not sure about the First Amendment in the aftermath of the killing of Charlie Kirk. Trump was ranting about protesters. He was blaming them for everything between, you know, violence and hating America. And he was asked, but don't they have a First Amendment right? They're protesting and Trump says chillingly, dystopianly, terrifyingly. I'm not so sure. That's a violent radical left group. Okay. Got a lot of comments for doing that. They still have their first amendment right. Those two are protesting. You've got an amazing team body. I'm not so sure. I'm not so sure about the First Amendment, the cornerstone of the Constitution. Even the Second Amendment extremists talk about the First and Second Amendment. And Trump talking about protesters bothering him makes it really clear. It's not only that deaths are more tragic when it's someone loyal to Trump. Trump is also making it clear that speech is more important when it is speech loyal to Trump. But when they don't agree with Trump, it's a problem. And a woman in many cases, women, you can see their professional agitators. I had one the other night. I had four the other night, all in one group, total phonies that started to scream when I got into a restaurant. Oh, you know, something with Palestine. I said, well, I'm doing a great job for peace in the Middle East. I should get lots of awards for that, right? With the Abraham Accords and everything else. But a woman just stood up and started screaming. And she got booed out of the place, too. There were a lot of people in the restaurant. I went there to show how safe and it was safe. I mean, a woman is just a mouthpiece. Oh, she was a paid agitator. And you have a lot of them. And I've asked Pam to look into that in terms of RICO, bringing RICO cases against the criminal RICO, because they should be put in jail. What they're doing to this country is really criminal RICO for protesting. Now, I know many of you have, excuse me, have written to me and you've said, David, you know, the protesters Trump's referring to its code pink code pink are like very anti-Ukraine. They defend China. They defend Russia. They defend totalitarian regimes. That that absolutely may be true. But criminal RICO for protesting, for voicing your opinion. And you can go back and look at Democrats and Republicans. You look at Reagan. You look at Bush. You look at the other Bush. You look at Obama, Biden, Nixon. They all would have instinctively said, of course, everyone has First Amendment rights. Of course, that's the bare minimum. It's democracy 101. But Trump can't even fake it.",,,,,,,,,KyWvUUPPgZM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyWvUUPPgZM,Trump: “Not so sure” about free speech,"Become a Member: https://www.davidpakman.com/membership

1739,"Have you ever had a school lockdown? I was in fourth grade and my class just finished recess. As we walked back to the building, our teachers walkie-talkie buzzed in. There's a crazy man with a weapon to your campus. We're going into lockdown. Uh-oh, let's get inside before it's too late. The school doors were locked and we were outside. Everyone's adrenaline kicked into overdrive as my teacher let out a battle cry. Choose a bus garage! Running for our literal lives as my twig body tried to keep up. We made it to the safe haven, which felt like a horror movie. But hey, at least we were surrounded by school buses. You know, if things went south, we had like 15 escape vehicles or 15 ways to run the guy over. Depends how you look at it. We all huddled in silence for hours and I was convinced I was gonna die in a freaking bus garage. I try not to make a single peep. Shh! Relax kid, I'm your principal. Anyways, what are you guys doing here? The lockdown ended hours ago. Oh, it looks like my walking, talking disconnected.

That will raise the total tariff on Indian imports to the United States to 50% - among the highest rates imposed by the US.

The new rate will come into effect in 21 days, so on 27 August, according to the executive order.

A response from India's foreign ministry on Wednesday said Delhi had already made clear its stance on imports from Russia, and reiterated that the tariff is ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable"".

- Introduction / Who making these -

Hey, I'm Jon also known as JonNario. 

I'm just your standard long term (7+ Year Old) Jaiden Fan from Puerto Rico,
who just wants to spread the joy of watching Jaiden and her shenanigans. 

There's a lot of highly editing in these clips (made by me) just because I want to make the moments more enjoyable than they already are... 
(honestly I do it because it's fun, there's literally no other reason..)

At the end of the day I want everyone to enjoy Jaiden the same way I do and that's it.

- Introduction / Who making these -

Hey, I'm Jon also known as JonNario. 

I'm just your standard long term (7+ Year Old) Jaiden Fan from Puerto Rico,
who just wants to spread the joy of watching Jaiden and her shenanigans. 

There's a lot of highly editing in these clips (made by me) just because I want to make the moments more enjoyable than they already are... 
(honestly I do it because it's fun, there's literally no other reason..)

At the end of the day I want everyone to enjoy Jaiden the same way I do and that's it.

Produced by @zanehelberg, he's a comedian and can be funny at times so feel free to go catch one of his shows if you're sad and need to laugh

ayo big thank you to Scott, my casting director as well! without the contestants, there is no show. and since i can't cast for my own videos, Scott is arguably the most clutch person on the team!! 

Sound by Matt McC, he doesn't have social media but he does have beautiful long hair. 

AD was Ty aka NeedACameraMan! My boy got the best production team in the LA. 

Mandie is our main camera operator! She operates the close up so if she's whipping too fast, yall can go at her in the comments lmaoo she also does the coloring on the videos too and she crushes it!

Shoutout our PA Kathrine too!! She's running all day long keeping the set organized and handing me energy drinks lmfaoooo

This one was edited by the GOAT Andy!! Andy is from the UK and goes to the gym everyday but is still really skinny... i dont understand it but his edits are fire. 

all in a day's work.

1888,,,,,,,,,,PaKket6br54,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaKket6br54,Syrian Swimmer returns home after 10 years to find her house destroyed,"UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador and former Syrian swimmer Yusra Mardini returned home to Syria to find most of her neighbourhood in Daraya destroyed, including the building where she once lived.

Located in the suburbs of Damascus, Daraya was repeatedly targeted by Russian and former Syrian government air strikes during 14 years of conflict.

While crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece in 2015, Yusra, along with her sister and two others, saved the lives of everyone in their dinghy by swimming beside the boat for several hours, navigating it to safety after the engine had failed—a story that inspired the 2022 Netflix film The Swimmers.

After finding refuge in Germany, Mardini went on to compete as a member of the first-ever Refugee Olympic Team at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and again at the Tokyo Games.

ABOUT CLUB RANDOM
In Club Random, Bill Maher unleashes his comedic wit on an unpredictable lineup – from Bill Burr and Jerry Seinfeld to Quentin Tarantino and Neil deGrasse Tyson – digging into everything but politics. It’s Maher in his familiar element: one-on-one vibes, unfiltered laughs, and the kind of freewheeling banter only he can deliver.

ABOUT BILL MAHER
Bill Maher was the host of “Politically Incorrect” (Comedy Central, ABC) from 1993-2002, and for the last 23 years on HBO’s “Real Time,” Maher’s combination of unflinching honesty and big laughs have garnered him 41 Emmy nominations. Maher won his first Emmy in 2014 as executive producer for the HBO series, “VICE.” In October of 2008, this same combination was on display in Maher’s uproarious and unprecedented swipe at organized religion, “Religulous.”

Maher has written six bestsellers: “True Story,” “Does Anybody Have a Problem with That? Politically Incorrect’s Greatest Hits,” “When You Ride Alone, You Ride with Bin Laden,” “New Rules: Polite Musings from a Timid Observer,” “The New New Rules: A Funny Look at How Everybody But Me Has Their Head Up Their Ass"", and most recently ""What This Comedian Said Will Shock You"".

There aren't many Vloggers I follow religiously. Emma is THE ONE.  Listening to her speak about life, coffee, fashion and food always feels like hanging with an old friend.

So thrilled to see her make what is a very natural transition to acting in Diablo Cody-produced FORBIDDEN FRUITS, exploring a clique of Momfluencers as their secrets threaten to destroy their carefully-cultivated personas.

Love everything about Emma, and also a big fan of her beverage products too, including her Chocolate Matcha.

Looking forward to what she brings to the Met Gala this year! 🖤",emma chamberlain|forbiddem fruits|toronto|chamberlain coffee,Mr. Will Wong,UC3bXSgCIGYLcApMWWxgxrqw,Mr. Will Wong,@themrwillwong,20250329,9,33631,573,3,Entertainment,en,Keyword_EmmaChamberlainfunny

Subscribe ► https://www.youtube.com/user/guardianwires?sub_confirmation=1

“We have toppled a political dynasty,” Mamdani told his supporters, before delivering a message to his opponent. ""I wish Andrew Cuomo only the best in private life but let tonight be the final time I utter his name.""

Mamdani also used the speech to directly address Donald Trump, who has threatened to cut funding to New York City if he won the race.

“After all, if anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him,” he said. “Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up.”

After months of silence following his controversy, he's back like nothing ever happened. 

The purpose of this video is to humor and acknowledge that the lack of an apology in Cody Ko's comeback is loud. I really enjoy(ed) Cody's content and it's pretty clear that his videos were a huge inspiration on my own style. I hope that he's able to do some needed reflecting, make amends, and come back to content creation without the scandal looming over him. But until then, it's unfair to the other parties involved to let this whole thing simply blow over.

ABOUT CLUB RANDOM
In Club Random, Bill Maher unleashes his comedic wit on an unpredictable lineup – from Bill Burr and Jerry Seinfeld to Quentin Tarantino and Neil deGrasse Tyson – digging into everything but politics. It’s Maher in his familiar element: one-on-one vibes, unfiltered laughs, and the kind of freewheeling banter only he can deliver. 

For advertising opportunities please email: PodcastPartnerships@Studio71us.com

ABOUT BILL MAHER
Bill Maher was the host of “Politically Incorrect” (Comedy Central, ABC) from 1993-2002, and for the last 23 years on HBO’s “Real Time,” Maher’s combination of unflinching honesty and big laughs have garnered him 41 Emmy nominations. Maher won his first Emmy in 2014 as executive producer for the HBO series, “VICE.” In October of 2008, this same combination was on display in Maher’s uproarious and unprecedented swipe at organized religion, “Religulous.”

Maher has written six bestsellers: “True Story,” “Does Anybody Have a Problem with That? Politically Incorrect’s Greatest Hits,” “When You Ride Alone, You Ride with Bin Laden,” “New Rules: Polite Musings from a Timid Observer,” “The New New Rules: A Funny Look at How Everybody But Me Has Their Head Up Their Ass"", and most recently ""What This Comedian Said Will Shock You"".
