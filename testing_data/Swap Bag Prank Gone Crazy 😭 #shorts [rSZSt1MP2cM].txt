That's my bag. How is this your bag? That's my bag. How? Do you mean how? That's my bag.
I got all my stuff in it. No, I've got my stuff and you've just picked it up. Can you
give me my bag back? Are you tripping out? No, I do. That's my bag. Now get up. Get up.
This is not your bag. It is my bag. Get off. Get off of my bag. This is not your bag.
Oh my God, your bag is right there. Oh. Look what you did to my clothes. How am I going
to go home like this? Oh my God.
