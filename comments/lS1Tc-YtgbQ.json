The boy takes the rifle, goes inside, you hear a shot, and the deed is done. The rest is up to your imagination. So movies of that time werent all that brutal.\r\n\r\nEven in John Wick the murder of his dog was depicted more detailed than in old Yeller.\r\n\r\nThe difference is, in old Yeller, you watch a movie where the whole story is about the bond building between the kid and the dog. And when the dog at the end gets rabbies it becomes so sad. And the onlything the boy could do for that dog was to end it, because there is no healing for rabbies, and the time the movie plays in had no regular vets that would put animals to sleep.\r\n\r\nI think it was a very educating movie about life. So there is no reason nowdays to do the same to your own pet, specialy because we got vets for puting them down peacefully.\r\nBut the movie is a wonderfull movie about the love between a dog and a kid.
