{"cid": "Ugztgq2aDsm97qe0wNN4AaABAg", "text": "I am 68 and my 3 younger siblings remember nothing! Sometimes a little inkling of something familiar will appear as I tell a story. But mostly they remember nothing of our shared experiences. How can you not remember riding in the Studebaker rumble seat on the way to the Jersey shore? (I was 7 and bro was 5). I remember our neighbors, their names, their pets, games we played, teachers, classmates, favorite clothes, Christmas gifts from every year and stuff our Mom disciplined us about. All I get is blank stares from them. Mom does not remember and will say “ Oh, that never happened”( Bish, are you serious? I can tell you word for word what you yelled about and the earrings you were wearing!).I can draw a floor-plan of the house we lived in when I was 3, as well as house when I was 4, and 6-7. I remember toilet training (2) and jumping from top of stairs to the bottom(3) as well as sneaking away from Dad and climbing the high dive at community pool and jumping in( age 4). How can my siblings not remember anything from the shared childhood? Sometimes I feel like the family narrator in a documentary about our early lives. Thank goodness my Dad also had a good memory because he would bust out laughing and be tickled I remembered so much ( such as him teaching me to use the skillsaw to make a birdhouse when I was 6.) It is 2025 and only one sibling remains and a few cousins. I get phone calls asking me ancestor health history and do I remember great grandparents names? Are you kidding me? How can you not know your families names? I can tell you their favorite flowers, pet peeves, college stories and herbal remedies. My best friend suggested I write all these memories down and someday, somewhere, someone will enjoy reading that my Gram used to play in Edison’s lab when she was a child in Metchen and woke him up from his nap. Someone will like to read about the day trips in the Model T ( bought 1908) to Camden New Jersey to see what “ the boys” were up to.( Wright Brothers 1910). Great grandfather, wife and kids would pack a lunch and set up a picnic blanket along the grass runway, with many other families, to watch “the boys “ try to fly. I find it amusing that in 2015  I designed a bathroom for their Great grand daughter in Naples Florida.
