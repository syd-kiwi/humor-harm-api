Are you kidding me!\nWhen did The Creation started to think that he is greater than the Creator??? Now that we have the Bible and we can read it it seems that we are becoming more foolish and every day! And it's because we keep on holding to religion to man's teaching, just as it was in the past when the Catholic church had the Monopoly of everything, from them stems theology, the idea that they know best that they had the perfect knowledge of God, yet they did not let you study or review the scriptures! But now that we do have access to the scriptures they'll just teach us nonsense and feel good ideas to make us believe that we do carry the spirit of God? But in reality we don't for they have manipulated so many things, have pushed our beliefs that are actually pagan origins, and just put a sticker of Christ on top of it... Satanic has not been hidden, he is always pushing the belief of satanism, just by not having the clear understanding of Jesus and who God Spirit really is which is his own, and we think that they are three divinities or distinctions in God, just there alone Satan has one!\nAre we not afraid that we are putting our faith in the hands of man? Are we not afraid that if he goes to hell what is the outcome for the followers? \nIt's time to wake up you have the word of God in your hands read it trust that God can give you his answers, the only true teachers we had Peter that was meant to go to the Jews and Paul to the gentiles, we had our teachers and they made students, so if you want to hold to true teachings go back to them and grab their understanding and hold to it, for the word of the Lord will last forever into eternity, it will never end, so we should trust in what they said and not with man is trying to teach us, for every man is corrupt every man wants to be king every man wants to have power every man wants to be a god, and that's how you know the Satan is behind it, he's been trying to teach us from the beginning to let us think we can be our own god, The only true Christian believers of the ones the have come out of the backs comma everything out of that have been tricked to believe they're Christians but in reality, they're far from doing what God says, and they're far from the truth, it all starts with understanding why Jesus came, and how he is tied to God the father, which is through the spirit of God that's what John said, and then to understand true repentance, and the meaning of the Covenant through the baptism of Jesus Christ, for there is no other name that we all will bow to accept jesus, for all authority has given to him, and the father says this is my son who I am well please, we will not find a God in a man, but only God himself is the one that deserves all worship, and that's why we worship him in spirit, and his name is Jesus, for this name it's not a man name but a heavenly name a name given to an angel to give to a man in Bethlehem, so we would know God's true name, and there is power in this name...", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "@lopjj14_yeah", "channel": "UCt-9-2Eddp0hVMnWCcwGNVA", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_msxh7mU1mr9dQTKgx9neVJAfRBs2jt04UjeuIdXLgIKeU=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1759527118.936698}
