If I’m black and live in the projects and have many kids I’m a stereotype but if someone calls me out on it should I call them racist and blast them online when I’m living that stereotype instead of breaking out that stereotype? I’m adding to making that racist and also depends on context of how person points it out or asks if I have a lot of children. \nOr if I’m Mexican and I get accused of jumping the border or my parents must have. That’s a stereotype. I can call someone racist for that but is it true first of all? Or is my parents actually illegal immigrants? So if we talk morals there’s endless ones today that we commercialize.\nAsk yourself do you listen to cardi B or Niki Minaj?\nDo you have an issue with them? They know their music is about giving their body around for fun and they know there are young girls who listen to their music. Where’s the moral stone on that? \nI ain’t gonna front I listen to some music with terrible morals but I don’t live by it.

When he educated himself and grew with time like most comedians or youtubers he apologized for the insensitivity and explained how he didn’t understand the weight of his words, he grew up with that kind of comedy. It’s definitely learned behavior that he unlearned and deeply apologized for and has been completely blacklisted and cancelled for these reasons which I somewhat understand nobody has to forgive or support but it’s been soooo many years since he’s said or done anything like that he is such a wholesome hilarious guy and he and his partner have been wanting a child and this surrogate was injected with both of their dna it is in no way related to the mother in that case, I’m not sure but I think the surrogate was Ryland’s sister who offered to help them many times with surrogacy.
