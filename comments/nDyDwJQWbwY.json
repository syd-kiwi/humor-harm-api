I had my 3yo and 2yo with me (3yo trained to touch the car and wait while I get 2yo inside and safe).  \n\nMy vehicle was ready to go and parked just outside the glass door where everyone could see us.  Took my babies out and gave my instructions expecting everything to be followed as usual.\n\nPut 2yo in and got her partially buckled (minimal security so I can look away from her) then checked to make sure 3yo followed my instructions.  She didn't and wasn't in sight where my line of sight left her near me.\n\nShut door on 2yo, walked around car to get eyes on 3yo and found her immediately at her door not touching the vehicle.  I pick her up and see one of the gentlemen on the opposite side of the car. He was paying close attention to details I couldn't in the moment and I was so thankful to him.  Gave 3yo a quick lecture and told her to say thank you and put her in her seat.\n\nI thank that man now and any other alert man who is still willing to help.  It's no excuse to let my guard down but it's nice to know I have that extra little bit of help when I see and experience it.\n\nAlso, at age 42, I'm just starting to get my gray hairs and my 20yo LOVES counting them for me. My younger siblings (ages 35 to 40 now) have been going gray and bald for the last 5 years.  I'm accused of coloring my hair like Mom does (also went gray in her 30s).
