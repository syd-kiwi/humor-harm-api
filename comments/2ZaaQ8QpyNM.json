I am going to repost a reply I made to an Eastern Orthodox brother.  For context, the commentor said the Catholics broke off in 1054 AD:\n\n\"Sort of, I'm a \"papist\" (Catholic).  We see the Great Schism the other way around, as the Eastern Orthodox broke off in what is presumed to be in or around 1054 AD.  While the Third Council of Toledo (Spain) in 539 AD added the Filioque without the consultation of the Eastern Patriarchates (who would later compose the distinction of Eastern Orthodox), the primacy of the Chair of Peter for the one singular institutional Church as a whole was and is in the west, in Rome.  The Great Schism was less theological and more sociopolitical.  In my view, that would be like the vice-president of the U.S. getting mad and breaking off to form his own de facto government because the President signed an Executive Order without consulting or including the VP; it might be inconsiderate, but it isn't required for the VP to be there or necessarily weigh in for the President to make a universal decision.\"\n\nI could be missing something here, but the Eastern Orthodox have also had problems within their own ranks (jurisdictional disputes, ethno-national divisions, etc.), , cause we are all human and mess things up from time-to-time.  Catholics are no exception.  \n\nHowever, if Peter did not have slightly greater authority, then why didn't Jesus evenly disperse the Keys to the Kingdom, one for each apostle, instead of handing them all to Peter who then gave them to the apostles?

{"cid": "UgxSTDLqoCJO6RYgTQh4AaABAg.ASKQ5e4yhSOASeVdF5rVev", "text": "​ @OrthodoxEthos Let me clarify; Christ gives authority directly to all the apostles, but He does not give it in an undifferentiated or flat way.  Peter obviously allowed other offices to exist apart from his distinct role.  Scripture shows a clear distinction between shared apostolic authority and a unique Petrine role. Peter receives the keys of the kingdom personally (Matt 16:19), his name is changed by Christ in a covenantal act, and he is charged alone to shepherd the entire flock (John 21:15–17). The later extension of binding and loosing to the other apostles does not nullify Peter’s singular commission; it presupposes it. Authority in Scripture is often shared without being equal in jurisdiction, just as all bishops share the episcopate without eliminating primacy among them. The fact that Peter does not “give” authority to the others is irrelevant, since Catholic theology does not claim Peter originates authority, only that Christ establishes an office in Peter that endures through succession.\n\nAppeals to the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed and the council of 879 do not undermine this. The theological content of the filioque existed in the West centuries before its liturgical insertion, and Rome never denied the Creed’s faith. The dispute was primarily disciplinary and linguistic, not a sudden doctrinal rupture in which Rome “left the Church.” The claim that 879 constitutes an ecumenical council binding on Rome is itself contested and depends on a selective use of reception that Orthodoxy does not apply consistently elsewhere. Likewise, portraying Pope Sergius IV in 1009 as the decisive break is historically inaccurate; the filioque was already established in Western usage, and communion between East and West continued in various forms long afterward. The schism was gradual, not the result of a single papal act.\n\nFinally, the argument that “Eastern Orthodoxy” and “Roman Catholicism” did not yet exist cuts against the Orthodox position, not the Catholic one. If those later categories did not yet exist, then what must be explained is why Rome was uniquely appealed to, corrected other churches, confirmed councils, and exercised authority beyond its local boundaries throughout the first millennium. Honor alone does not account for this pattern. What developed over time was not Roman primacy, which is already visible early on, but Eastern resistance to its implications.", "time": "3 days ago", "author": "@Katholikos93", "channel": "UCUDfYvUYT3Id0ixTsiCM-oQ", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_n7417ek-18wzJI3ZENBm0JLEsWrCcksbQ7WKdHv1tzFUdXjGULqP2rM3Knc8d3lEC4qw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1769897689.976787}
