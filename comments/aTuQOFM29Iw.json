While the Online Safety Act 2023 introduced new offenses, these older laws criminalize messages that are grossly offensive, indecent, obscene, menacing, or persistently harassing. Concerns have been raised by civil liberties groups about the impact on free speech, noting that most arrests do not result in conviction. \n\nKey details on arrests for online communication in 2023\n\nNumber of arrests: Over 12,000 arrests were made, which is more than 30 a day.\n\nLegislative basis: Arrests were made under existing laws, such as Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003, which covers messages that are \"grossly offensive, indecent, obscene, or menacing\".\n\nIncrease in arrests: The number of arrests in 2023 represented a nearly 58% increase compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019.\n\nImpact on free speech: Some civil liberties groups have expressed concern that these laws are being used to police controversial speech and could have a chilling effect on free speech.\n\nOutcome: Many cases do not result in a conviction, but individuals can still face detention and reputational damage simply from the arrest itself.\n\nOnline Safety Act 2023: This act introduced new criminal offenses related to online content, though it is important to note that the 2023 arrests were also under the pre-existing legislation.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "@paulwright3465", "channel": "UCP3eyFlIJ-75P2nhdkJnHkA", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_lme7P95g8IcvaCWlGLB1O6ePvDF6xkXxzjHrNBnF4=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1764801322.254841}
