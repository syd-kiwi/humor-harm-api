So maybe that's why i cant fathom it. \n\nBut idk how you can eat over 4 feet of a 6 feet sub in one sitting and again im a fatass that loves food too but theres literally 36 sandwhiches in a 6 foot sub, and as ethan said he ate more then 3 feet, but lets be generous and say he ONLY ate 3 feet meaning only half of it.....thats still.....literally.......At minimum.....18 fucking sandwhiches.....in one sitting.....\n\nI completely disagree with the hosts calling him out and making a huge scene about it and being big assholes about it making it a huge issue thats really fucked up and they are def assholes/the asshole for that. BUT AT THE SAME TIME hes also absolutely an asshole/the asshole for eating 18 sandwhiches (again thats being generous it was more) in one sitting, half of which were for other people, in the first hour of a party thats meant to be hours and hours long that is fucking wild and thats coming from a fellow fatass that loves and is addicted to food. \n\nthe friends texting him the next morning saying you need to get your shit together/in order/under control aren't wrong. 18 plus sandwhiches in one sitting half of which are meant for others is wild \n\n( \"i waited an hour so i thought everyone lost interest.\" Every party i've ever been to the party is literal hours and hours long to potentially the entire day/night the sub usually isn't meant to be the main meal at a party its meant to be picked on throughout the night/party that's literally the entire point of it. its doesn't need to be/isn't meant to be rushed through and fully eaten within the first hour of like a 6 plus hour party lol. Wether it be my family/relatives parties with plenty of other fat people or my fit friends parties with only me and maybe sometimes 1 other fat person there is literally always tons of food left by the end of the night that everybody takes home portions of ESPECIALLY INCLUDING the sub hell the sub is usually the main thing left that theres the most of left haha again because thats the whole point of it its not like other party foods and hot foods where it needs to be rushed through) \n\n(if you truly knew the sub was going to be the only food/meal at the party beforehand which was/is a really dumb thing for them to do for all the reasons i just stated. And if that's the case then Hila was right more food was needed. Literally never been to a single party wether it be skinny people or fat people that didn't have someone cooking or buying dinner/dinners a meal/meals and have more food in general instead of literally just a single sub.
