Also I felt like my blood was boiling, and like hydrogen peroxide was being dumped on my brain (that bubbling sensation.) Turns out I didn't need them because I wasn't depressed- I just had the occasional anxiety attack and sometimes antidepressants help with that, apparently. Except the reason I was feeling those terrible side effects is because I was bordering on Serotonin poisoning. So I guess something about being in your early 20's, a new mother with the occassional crippling anxiety attack (and I'm sure living in Portland didn't help) my doctor make the assumption that I MUST be medically depressed.
