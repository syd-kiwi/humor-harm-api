I had NO idea that it was a “tactical” gear store so focused on militia/ former law enforcement types but marketed like “adventure gear”. I walked in and it was like the record scratch moment- everyone was white and their jaws literally dropped. \n\nWhen I looked at a tag on a pair of cute pants and saw that it marketed being able to hold a concealed pistol in the side pocket, I realized that I was not in an off-brand REI. I decided to go with it though. I walked up to a sale associate and said “Hi- I’m looking for a long sleeve outdoor shirt with embedded insect repellent, and SPF 50 coating. This is an adventure store, right?”  The sales associate turned bright red and mumbled “oh, I don’t think we have that.”  I smiled sweetly at her and said “Oh, you should tell your managers to think about selling those- looks like your clientele could use some SPF protection.”  Then walked out.
