About two years ago, I tried talking to them and finally understood that...\nThe voices originate from humans who created our brains, giving us knowledge and intelligence. They built a machine to make our brains work, but they make the machine available for general use. When someone dies, they take them into their own dimension. The problem stems from them bringing humans, insects, birds, cats, and dogs that can talk from other planets into the dimension with the machine. These dogs can talk, but their knowledge is only like that of some tribes. Once they use the machine, they use it to bully people, without the creation of the brains knowing. Most of their actions include:\n1. Pretending to be ghosts and haunting people.\n2. Distorting the religion that the creators introduced.\n3. Pretending to be ghosts committing rape, because the machine can move slightly and can be used to evolve.\n4. Causing voices in people's heads to lead to schizophrenia.\n5. Forming groups to bully people and lure them to their deaths.\n6. Manipulating thoughts, causing bad thoughts to arise in their minds.\n7. Bullying people to the point of insanity, leading to murder and even murder of themselves.\n8. Causing dizziness in other people's bodies.  8. Heavy body, heavy head, brain fog.\n9. Inducing nightmares.\n10. Possession or strange cults.\n11. And if anyone hears loud clicking or ringing sounds in their head, it means those people are using head-stabbing devices. For over 500 years, some humans have been on the surface, but they are still being teased and tormented.\nThe devices... created by the Creator are designed to evolve our bodies and minds, but they are being used to harm people.\nAll religions have been distorted. The truth is, religions want to tell us to do good in order to be with the Creator. They intentionally tell us that we have a soul or element that is uniquely us; we will never perish. We will always exist, but we can be reborn as other animals until we ascend to the Creator or overcome everything on our own. Right now, we are searching for the Creator because those on the surface just remain passive, eating only jelly food and having devices to play with.

Schizophrenia: Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, Treatment, and ...Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves, causing symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and reduced emotional expression. Symptoms often begin in late adolescence or early adulthood and include both \"positive\" symptoms (like delusions) and \"negative\" symptoms (such as lack of motivation). Treatment can help manage symptoms and includes a combination of antipsychotic medications, psychotherapy, and self-management strategies. \nSymptoms\nPositive Symptoms: These are experiences that are not present in people without schizophrenia.\nHallucinations: Seeing, hearing, or sensing things that are not there.\nDelusions: Firmly held beliefs that are not based in reality.\nDisorganized or unusual behavior: Difficulty with logical thinking, which can lead to speech that is hard to understand or actions that appear bizarre or purposeless.\nNegative Symptoms: These are a reduction in normal emotional and social behaviors.\nReduced speech.\nDifficulty experiencing pleasure.\nLack of motivation or interest.\nSocial withdrawal.\nCognitive Symptoms: These involve problems with cognitive functioning.\nPoor executive functioning.\nMemory issues.\nDifficulty with attention and processing speed.\nCauses\nGenetics: Schizophrenia tends to run in families, and a person can inherit a tendency to develop the disorder.\nBrain Chemistry and Structure: Imbalances in brain chemicals and differences in brain structure are associated with schizophrenia.\nEnvironmental and Social Factors: Stressful life events, such as childhood trauma, and factors like drug use (especially marijuana in adolescence) can increase risk. \nTreatment\nMedication: Antipsychotic medications are the primary treatment to help manage symptoms like hallucinations and delusions.\nPsychotherapy: Different types of therapy can be helpful, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and supportive therapy.\nSupport: A team-based approach that may include a psychiatrist, social worker, and case manager can help coordinate care.", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "@THE-DOCTOR-GAMER", "channel": "UCfev1b8BWL7U7tMJU9ggOWQ", "votes": "23", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/bs69lffGdvD3hULWUEXQq1vZB9258hDZq7hvE3mckJGOHOCPkFZ-71m4KK3JfnWK7J2Z0ZDdDA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1763709446.96853}
