{"cid": "Ugy5i5POLiM1A2DHvvt4AaABAg", "text": "Last night, I had an interesting dream that could be a side-note to the Topic of why some suburbs are quite a bit nicer than others, issues of historical repression & discrimination aside, although many of the people who Live there may be quite nice regardless. I was driving along with that Superfly British Bruv from Love is Blind UK, he mentioned something about his \"core\" being strong, I replied that my core is not strong atm, physically speaking. Then he asked me to drop him off at his Girlfriend's Home, and that’s when things started to get a little bit strange. His Girlfriend’s Home was in a very nice apartment complex, but located in one of the low-income and quite run-down suburbs here in Brisbane, which is another matter of \"social inequality\" that I need to discuss. When I arrived at that apartment complex at night time there was a cement moat around it, which made it much more difficult to get in, teetering on the edge of the moat about to fall into it was a Citreon SM, a very nice classic car, parked securely beside the moat not teetering was a very nice Lexus GSF with 666 hp (1). The British Bruv then proceeds to hand me a phone, a very old phone, and it shows sort of a top-down, very grainy video of that car accelerating along a road somewhere. \n\nI think the meaning behind this dream pertains to the fact that where you Live should be considered part of Your Core, not from a physical point of view, but in terms of Who You Are, and a very valuable part at that core for being an appreciating asset if you take care of it accordingly. I believe fancy phones, fancy cars, and other items that are much more temporary and depreciate in value, should be considered much less so. Spending your hard-earned money on the latter over the former, including from a debt servicing point of view, will prevent you from being able to improve your core, build wealth, and achieve a higher Standard of Living, doing the opposite will improve the standard of Your Suburb as well, although the lack of Public Investment is also an issue. I'm not sure what the deal is with the two different cars, other those who focus on Building Wealth, rather than \"appearing rich\" (usually on debt), don't tend to buy the \"latest & greatest\", they will buy something nice, and then hold onto it for a while. Of course, having a (legal) job also helps, and although there are some people who are just downright \"deficient\" in thinking that is somehow a negative, others have faced all sorts of social issues that have impeded their capacity to Get Ahead in Life.\n\n1. Note, I mentioned how nice this car was, and it is a very nice car, very well built with a high quality interior, but I think the 666hp pertains top the way that it appeals to some people. It's mechanical power is a much more superficial & temporary factor compared to Where You Live and What You Can Do therein, as being a Place to Grow Your Life, & so forth. The Manufacturer aside, which in the case of Lexus is only trying to build a High Quality Automobile and sell it at an appropriate price, if the purchase of that vehicle becomes an exercise in enriching the rich at the expense of Yourself & Others in Your Community, I think it should be considered the work of the devil.", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "@the_apocalypse888", "channel": "UCvdjupXX40vImO-8RzAenoQ", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/Vsa6J6jsxyYO8_xhCUzHN7ckwjyHngtnLnbQNLUCZOkf67TJVzi07ngnoegaNLkU_LFZPkmb8A=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1754255817.291101}
