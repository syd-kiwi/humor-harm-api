{"cid": "UgzcTAMzDRI6aXg_M5x4AaABAg", "text": "10.8.25- Added disclaimer about what I've seen of CK's debates. May CK rest in peace. \n\n10.2.25-\nI just uploaded 2 videos on \"The Big Picture of the Bible\" very helpful for new or seasoned followers of our Messiah, Jesus Christ, the olive-skinned , Middle-eastern looking, brown-haired, brown-eyed (odds are), Jewish carpenter from Nazareth, whose sandals we are unworthy to unstrap.\n\nNuance added 10.4.25:\nI'm trying to \"meet people where they are\" in their temporarily spiritually immature thinking, often young people of various skin tones, precious souls who God loves, who hopefully won't stay concerned about Jesus' physical appearance. In my ancient 49-year-old opinion, Jesus' physical appearance does not matter, His mission does, and none of us were there, but based on who He was, a Jewish carpenter, God in the flesh, we can make guesses and rule out, I believe, with a HIGH degree of certainty, the silly Renaissance notion of Jesus being pale, with blond hair and blue eyes. Isaiah even seems to rule out the idea of Jesus being handsome - \"having no form or majesty that we should desire him\".\n\nOnward...\n\n9.17.25- I welcome the wolves to this chat. God (or perhaps just the algorithm) seems to be using your hatred of Charlie and God and all that is decent and good in the world like it's electricity to this one of millions of temporary digital microphones Charlie bought with his blood, that flawed Christ followers are speaking from, on a channel of a nobody, and God seems to be using the view count increase and subscribers (truth seekers) increase, and likes increase, and shares increase, and comments increase, like they are wattage to this temporary digital speaker. To God be the glory. The spreading light consumes the dark. Jesus is Lord. Jesus is the good shepherd. Not Charlie Kirk. And if Charlie was alive and saw me, who has never met him, type the above words, he might type: \"amen\" (just my opinion)\n-dmh 9.17.25\n\n\"Aslan is on the move. He is not a tame lion\" - paraphrased from separate sections of C.S. Lewis's \"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe\"\n\n\n   James 1:19 — “quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger.” \n\nI’m praying for Charlie’s wife, kids, and everyone shaken by this.\n\n\nMay God have mercy on us.\n..........\nBack in the early days of the church, they would stone you for standing up for your beliefs.\nNow, you can get shot.\n\n.......\n\nWhen the first martyr Stephen was stoned in Acts 7, he cried out:\n\"Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” (Acts 7:60, ESV)\n\nI didn’t know Charlie Kirk personally — but based on what I’ve seen,\nhe grew in his faith during his public life and became quite respectful toward many (if not most?) of those who disagreed with him.\n\nI want to believe, if he had the chance, he would have said the same thing Stephen did:\n\nActs 7:59–60 (ESV):\n59. And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”\n60. And falling to his knees he cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” And when he had said this, he fell asleep.\n\nThat’s the kind of man I want to believe Charlie was,\nbased on videos I’ve seen of how kindly he treated many of his *opponents.\n\n*Disclaimer added 10.8.25-\nTo date I've only seen approximately (wild guess)- 0.001% of the 10 or so years (?) of TPUSA video footage of CK, and mainly just clips, but I did see the whole non-TPUSA Club Random Bill Maher & Charlie Kirk podcast (on Charlie Kirk's channel) where Charlie commented on how it went, and I saw several minutes of the Jubilee debate video- Chalie Kirk vs. College Students).... but based on the limited footage I've seen of Charlie’s \"Christian apologetics era\" (for lack of a better word), inspired by Frank Turek and Ray Comfort ... I'll say:\n.......\n\nCharlie wasn’t perfect. He misspoke at times — as we humans tend to do.\nHe said controversial things — but controversial things are often true.\n\nExample:\n\n The resurrection of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\n= highly controversial AND true at the same time.\n\n\n\nCharlie’s is the kind of courage and grace we need more of, in my opinion.\n– dmh\n\n.......\n\nIn this episode of Club Random, Charlie Kirk joins Bill Maher\nfor a wide-ranging conversation that aired on April 20, 2025.\n\nAt one point, Charlie and Bill briefly discuss the need for personal security —\na passing moment that now feels sobering in retrospect.\n\n4 months and 21 days later, Charlie was shot and killed.\n\n.......\n\nReports as of Sep 12 say the bullet casings at the scene were engraved with:\n\n“Hey, fascist! CATCH!”\n\nLyrics from the anti-fascist song “Bella Ciao”\n\n“If you read this, you are gay LMAO”\n\n“Notices bulge, OWO what’s this?”\n\n\n.......\n\nWhether you agreed with Charlie or not,\nthis wasn’t just about politics —\nit was about the cost of standing up for your beliefs\nin an increasingly volatile culture.\n\n.......\n\n🙏 Pray for God's will to be done with justice for Charlie Kirk's family.\n\n🕊️ May Charlie rest in peace.\n\n🛐 May God comfort and protect his wife and kids.\n\nGod is a God of mercy,\nbut also a God of justice.\n\nDon’t take freedom of speech for granted (preaching to myself)\n\nJesus is Lord.\n\n🕊️ Be excellent to each other.\n\n.......\n\nAn atheist-turned-preacher once said:\n\n1. God loves you\n\n\n2. God wants you\n\n\n3. God made a way for you and me — & even murderers — to be with Him:\n(The cross. Jesus is the way.)\n\n\n4. The devil will do everything he can to keep you from believing the first 3.\n\n.......\n\n🙏 Want to Know How to Be Saved?\n\n📖 The Bible teaches a simple but powerful pattern:\n\n\n---\n\n1. Hear the Gospel\n\n> “So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.”\n— Romans 10:17 (ESV)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n2. Believe in Jesus Christ\n\n> “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.”\n— John 3:16 (ESV)\n\n\n\n> “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.”\n— Mark 16:16 (ESV)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n3. Repent of Your Sins\n\n> “The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.”\n— Acts 17:30 (ESV)\n\n\n\n> “Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out.”\n— Acts 3:19 (ESV)\n\n\n\n> “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”\n— Acts 2:38 (ESV)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. Confess Jesus as Lord\n\n> “Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”\n— Romans 10:9 (ESV)\n\n\n\n> “For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.”\n— Romans 10:10 (ESV)\n\n\n\n> “Everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven.”\n— Matthew 10:32 (ESV)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. Be Baptized Into Christ\n\n> “And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.”\n— Acts 22:16 (ESV)\n\n\n\n> “Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you—not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”\n— 1 Peter 3:21 (ESV)\n\n\n\n> “We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.”\n— Romans 6:4 (ESV)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n6. Live a Faithful Life\n\n> “Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.”\n— Revelation 2:10 (ESV)\n\n\n\n> “...not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another…”\n— Hebrews 10:25 (ESV)\n\n\n\n> “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.”\n— 1 John 1:7 (ESV)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n✝️ Summary:\n\nHear\n\nBelieve\n\nRepent\n\nConfess\n\nBe Baptized\n\nRemain Faithful\n\n\n.......\n\n> “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved…”\n— Mark 16:16\n\n\n\n> “Repent and be baptized… for the forgiveness of your sins…”\n— Acts 2:38\n\n\n\n> “Baptism now saves you…”\n— 1 Peter 3:21\n\n\n\n> “Be faithful unto death…”\n— Revelation 2:10\n\n\n\n.......\n\nJesus is Lord. Obey the Gospel. Call on His Name. Walk in the Light.\n\n– dmh\nDraft 1, 9.11.25\nDraft 2, 9.12.25\nUpdated at top 9.13.25, 9.17.25\n\nUpdate 10.2.25:\nI just uploaded 2 videos on \"The Big Picture of the Bible\" very helpful for new or seasoned followers of our Messiah.", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "@David.Michael.Harvey", "channel": "UCuCUZKoFBoUZx6sdVtLH4TA", "votes": "640", "replies": "124", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/GbjmABAa6yxLw66G8aQ-McDWADYoSXeOJQIAEJJTuhR6qJeqMXI9o78gNlNMr7abcus8PGzs4zY=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1759527840.245732}
