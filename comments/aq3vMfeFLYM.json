I don't know whether to sing amor or whistle Dixie. Was that funny. I had a New York City accent from the Bronx Italian. First year in North Carolina 1978 first day of school I had one month of the fifth grade left. A girl came up to me and asked me what country I was from because of my accent. I said I'm from New York that's in this country. My accent was so strong the next year in school they put me in speech class. After about a week the teacher said this guy doesn't have a speech impediment he has a New York City accent. I'm the world's only Bronx Italian redneck.
