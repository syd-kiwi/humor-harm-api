We just gotta see what’s on that video supposedly there’s only partial video but what’s crazy is $50,000 bond I almost went to the courthouse cause it was this morning. I was gonna go. He was in Ontario at a con Friday and Saturday and everyone was lucky that he didn’t cancel on them for everyone that paid for Photos with him I was gonna go, but because it’s Grammy weekends I didn’t go.\nFor some reason Da and those Police have always had a hard on and they never give him the benefit of the doubt I get it. He was in jail. He was a model prisoner or whatever but isn’t it crazy how you can be a Nepo baby being the best movies ever and still you don’t get any preferential treatment I find it Nuts I feel like at first maybe the Uber driver might have set him up. We don’t even know the identity of the Uber driver.\nBecause it would be in Kiefer’s best interest to just pony up the checkbook and give him 100 K to just say this was a misunderstanding and I’m totally OK with that because I just love him to death.
