Transportation only accounts for roughly 25% of emissions in America.even if you eliminated all those emissions, it wouldn't change a single thing. We are adding to climate change, but nothing we do will prevent it from happening. We're speeding it up by maybe a few centuries. That all aside, there're ways to be carbon neutral and still drive a car, believe it or not. And they are very easy.\n\nI drive an SUV and am completely carbon neutral.
