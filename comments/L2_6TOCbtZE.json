Dead serious none of my dogs act like these Little devils that I see on TV.....mostly because I wouldn't allow it and Cesar Millan'ed corrected them from day 1.\n\nCats are a nononono (my Doberman wants to eat them.) Other dogs and people no problems..... But I do allow Open season on very young dogs/puppies.\n\nYou've heard the expression it takes a village to raise a child... When it comes to dogs the whole pack raises the puppies and you can end up with some older cantankerous dogs who like to step up and give the young whippersnapper a little bit of a correction every once in a while. \n\nI have an almost 2 year old Doberman it is so funny to see my middle-aged chocolate and tan sweetheart of a chihuahua trying to jump up and nail the Doberman on her nose.... She's needing something like a ladder or a trampoline to get up that high.  LOL.  Even my youngest Chihuahua will reprimand her every once in a while even though the youngest Chihuahua and the Doberman are the best of buddies.... Funny as heck to watch those two play together too, it looks like David and Goliath all over again\n\nAnd speaking of age I have been very blessed.  My oldest Chi is named Pippa, after Princess Catherine's sister.  Pippa was already 4 or 5 when I adopted her, I adopted her the day before Prince William's and Princess Catherine's wedding day 2011.  \n\nWhen Philippa was was helping Princess Catherine out of the vehicle and she turned around and showed off that magnificent dress, that decided it my new pup Pippa.\n\nShe's been with me for 15 years, was 5 or 6 when I got her, which puts her at 20 + years...... And she's still runs around, hippity hoppity which is a Pippa thing.  \n\nShe doesn't hear and see as well as she did and I think she might be a little senile but people are actually shocked when I tell them she's 20 years old because she does move and act like a much younger dog. \n\nMy third Chi is between 8 and 10 and she's my velcro dog.  She's one of the deer type chihuahuas who is very insecure and extremely clingy.....
