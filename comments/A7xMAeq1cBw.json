{"cid": "UgywiqT5lbPS4f8Oswt4AaABAg", "text": "This is similar to the Native American sports branding controversy. Even though some people dont find it offensive, it is not okay. American sports teams have incorporated elements from different cultures into their branding, and Indigenous customs and traditions are most commonly used. The use of Native American names and branding for sports teams is a controversial topic; some find it insensitive, while others don’t see why. However, when sports teams use Native American tribal names as their own, it is a form of cultural appropriation and is very disrespectful to Indigenous identities. Additionally, sports teams portray Native Americans incorrectly in their branding, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and trivializing Indigenous culture.  Finally, these sports teams create biases that encourage discrimination against Indigenous Americans. Native American-themed names and branding should not be used by sports teams because of the harm it causes to Indigenous individuals and communities.\nThe appropriation of Native American tribe names for sports teams disrespects and commodifies Indigenous identities. Using a tribal name for a sports team strips it from its rightful owners and diminishes the reverence that it deserves. According to an article about the Native American mascot controversy, “Indigenous peoples see the cultural appropriation of names] as a deeply personal matter of individual and collective identity” (Young). The use of an Indigenous tribal name demonstrates cultural insensitivity by attributing Native American names to those who do not belong to the community. Taking away ownership of a name disrespects its significance, allowing it to be used without regard for its original cultural meaning. Additionally, using Indigenous names for entertainment or commercial purposes is unfair and insensitive towards Indigenous communities. As sources explain, “Euro-American whites have argued that such names are not insensitive and that a change in brand would damage a team's tradition, popularity, and economics” (Auerbach). A team’s popularity should not be at the expense of a marginalized racial group. Indigenous peoples' culture should be respected and not exploited for entertainment. Native American tribe names should not be used for sports teams because of the lack of proper knowledge and respect for them. \nIn addition to cultural appropriation, sports teams’ inaccurate and offensive portrayal of Native Americans perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Indigenous peoples and trivializes their history and culture. Many Native American-themed sports teams have used the term “redskins,” which promotes that idea that offensive language towards Indigenous communities is acceptable.\nThe term “redskins” is believed to have originated in the 18th century, to describe Native Americans’ skin which was perceived by Europens to always be covered in blood from constant warfare (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica). This stereotype depicts Indigenous Americans as violent and barbaric, reinforcing harmful misconceptions. The normalization of this dehumanizing label diminishes the significance of Indigenous identities by disregarding the impact thereof. Moreover, logos, caricatures, and face paint of Native Americans misinform society that Indigenous peoples are not also contemporary individuals who live modern and civilized lives. Many people observed in baseball games that \"the Milwaukee Braves began to feature a caricature of an Indigenous man…costumed and adorned with war paint who would emerge from a teepee to dance whenever a team member hit a home run” (Auerbach). These portrayals of Native Americans inaccurately represent these communities, creating a distorted and superficial image of Indigenous culture. When sports teams’ create false and insulting \nportrayals of Native Americans, these stereotypes are created.\nThe stereotypes that sports teams contribute to also encourage discrimination against \nIndigenous Americans. Being stereotyped can create biases against Indigenous people, which can be unfair and even unsafe. In a survey conducted, 34 percent of Native Americans reported discrimination in healthcare (Young). Sports teams’ use of Indigenous-themed branding can hinder the progress of racial equality in America. Furthermore, these biases can cause discrimination in the workplace too. In America, Indigenous peoples have the highest unemployed population and are proven to be less likely to get raises and promotions (Young). While not only disrespecting Indigenous peoples, Native American-themed branding has proven to also negatively affect their daily lives.\nUltimately, Native American-themed names and branding causes racial offense to Indigenous individuals and communities and should not be used. The appropriation of Native American tribe names for sports teams disrespects and commodifies Indigenous identities. Also, the use of racially inaccurate and insulting branding degrades Indigenous peoples by reducing their history and culture to a stereotype. Finally, Indigenous-themed branding encourages discrimination against Indigenous Americans. American sports teams should not victimize Indigenous peoples, but they should promote equality by giving everyone the respect they deserve.", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "@stillcomingdownfrom", "channel": "UCVNkh3BIPGL9iddtGKkHg9w", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/U7ZX_V9UOWfXMnQQY3u6O9ldCBbEkoTqCIqFCS4oyuBEYDJFSPrBbSlD8avu1Tu5nYJ6EyVeMr8=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1764800631.553028}
