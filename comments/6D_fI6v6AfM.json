{"cid": "UgxpjY57WVUWZ_P8RAB4AaABAg", "text": "I was looking for a cat for my other cat. He grew up wrestling with 2 big dogs, but his reign of terror over all of us pretty much doubled all of a sudden and he was getting really fat. We tried fostering first, just to make sure he was cool with another cat in his house, and my God, he LOVED them all IMMEDIATELY. Unfortunately, besides chirping and reaching under quarantine/bathroom doors, he shows his love by pile driving other cats into the ground as soon as they meet. So the kittens we fostered were either: too little, too skittish, or too afraid of my dogs or fiancé (because he committed the crime of being born a man). I had to go to the shelter we were fostering for and just pick one out after all. I found a weirdo who was only 4 months old but 1/3 bigger his brother (very big). He was still \"figuring people out\" despite having been in a foster home all his life and having very outgoing siblings. He stared at me, then ran away (I thought), only to turn around and smack my hand around (no claws involved). He kept reaching for me through the slats of the cage after the glass door was closed with massive pupils but was just. A totally awkward weirdo. So I brought him home and he is still a lil freak but 100% best friends with our other cat AND big enough to wrestle with him AND unafraid of the dogs. And still \"figuring people out\" tbh, but he is very affectionate when his feelings don't send him bolting around the house at random.", "time": "4 weeks ago", "author": "@emmaw2972", "channel": "UCVQuUuAdZmo1a1bktyPJzDw", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_lmY4Z4b4AU9KgR9afw4v904p4JZo1unsZx405WRxriw0k=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1767737930.505084}
