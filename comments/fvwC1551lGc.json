This censorship is having negative consequences for social media, with millions in losses, misinformation, and psychological effects on users. All this to defend a \"harmful and unhealthy woke order.\" They also have the nerve to pressure other countries to adopt this political-ideological censorship system they apply. This could explode into a massive online demonstration of rejection of that order.

Keir Starmer's government defends illegal immigrants and criminals more than its own people; it is without a doubt the worst government in history. With the Online Safety Act, they aren't seeking to protect children; that's an excuse. They seek to control and manipulate personal data and engage in political and ideological espionage, threatening to sanction those who oppose their leftist order with bans, fines, and imprisonment.

{"cid": "UgzRp8tD4qMn2hflCzR4AaABAg", "text": "Here are the three steps that are needed to get saved and be right with God who loved us all, for eternal life with him! \r\n\r\nAs everyone and anyone can get saved! :)\r\n\r\n1- Admit that you’re a sinner and be willing to turn from your own self righteousness to God (Psalms 5: 4-5, 24: 3, Romans 3: 23).\r\n\r\nPsalms 5: 4-5 (KJB)\r\n4.\"For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.\"\r\n5.\"The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.\"\r\n\r\nPsalms 24: 3 (KJB)\r\n\"Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?\"\r\n\r\nRomans 3: 23 (KJB)\r\n“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”\r\n\r\n2- Believe onto Jesus Christ, who being the only begotten Son of God He loved, died on the cross, was buried and resurrected for the full forgiveness of our sins, all as a freely given gift out of God’s genuine love towards us sinners (Romans 5: 8-9, 1 John 4: 9-10, 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4).\r\n\r\nRomans 5: 8-9 (KJB)\r\n8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\"\r\n9.\"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.\"\r\n\r\n1 John 4: 9-10 (KJB)\r\n9.\"In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.\"\r\n10.\"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.\"\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB)\r\n1.\"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;\r\n2.\"By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.”\r\n3.\"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;”\r\n4.\"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”\r\n\r\n3-  Confess onto God, asking to be saved accepting this loving free gift of salvation, to start a new life of being born again, after being saved and forgiven from all your sins (Romans 10: 9-10+13, John 3: 15-17, Ephesians 2: 8-9). :)\r\n\r\nRomans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB)\r\n9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”\r\n10.\"For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\"\r\n13.\"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\"\r\n\r\nJohn 3: 15-17 (KJB)\r\n15.\"That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\"\r\n16.\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"\r\n17.\"For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”\r\n\r\nEphesians 2: 8-9 (KJB)\r\n8.\"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:\"\r\n9.\"Not of works, lest any man should boast.”\r\n\r\n4- Otherwise you will have to pay the wages for any/all of your sins, on your own, which is to face Gods eternal judgment, of burning forever in hell,  to not be able to sin before God ever again (Hebrews 9: 27-28, Revelation 21: 8, 14: 10-11 Romans 6: 23).\r\n\r\nHebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB)\r\n27.\"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:\"\r\n28.\"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”\r\n\r\nRevelation 21: 8 (KJB)\r\n\"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”\r\n\r\nfrom Revelation 14: 10-11 (KJB)\r\n10.\"The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:\"\r\n11.\"And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night”\r\n\r\nRomans 6: 23 (KJB)\r\n“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”\r\n\r\n(Lastly an example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.)\r\n\r\n“Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving.\r\nI know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. \r\nI need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ.I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. \r\nI trust in him alone to save me. \r\nNothing else. \r\nNot my good works or anything else. \r\nOnly Jesus. \r\nI pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "@crossvinburn831", "channel": "UCMhCV85kXyOc94OxxpyE_pA", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_ktqy1O9ZMmtieFCVhktcadGmGeip91BZeI6raorAXQdqX547fkG-1ICr6To3C9zosJlQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1756935699.420252}
