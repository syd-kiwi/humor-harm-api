If you found out your uncle did it in ‘92, you wouldn’t give a fuck.\n\nHe absolutely deserves to be publicly shamed for it, and frankly I haven’t really been able to see him the same since or watch his content.\n\n But he’s a husband and father and the shit happened a decade ago. People change. It’s not like a pedo where there is no growing out of it; he was a frat-boy asshole. Maybe he’s still an asshole, or maybe not. We don’t know him, so we don’t know.\n\nJust saying, I honestly don’t know if I think he should have to go to prison for ten years and introduce himself to his neighbors for the rest of his life when right now, he just seems like a normal dude with a family that fucked up when he was a younger, dumb kid. Then again, he knew the risk and the potential punishment, and he did it anyway, so idk. I just honestly don’t hate him just because of this.\n\nIf anything, I’m less upset about the stupid shit he did when he was younger and more upset about the rapist he apparently invited to his wedding and somewhat cowardly way he went about handling everything after it came out.

She was a minor at the time, not a \"child\".  People don't turn 18 and roll over from childhood to adulthood, there is more nuance to aging and maturing than that and acting like there isn't is harmful to the conversation. \n\nThe laws exist in order to protect everyone regardless of individual maturity.  The law is black and white so as to protect everybody equally, and it's not the purpose of the law to be open to interpretation as such.  Was Cody wrong and unlawful in his behaviour?  Of course he was, but I don't want to be on the side of the argument that pretends that what he did was just as bad as it would be to SA a six year old child. \n\nCody should be punished what he did, whether it be legally, or communally, people need to decide whether they want him to retain his platform; whether they believe or not that what he did was so immoral that he shouldn't be allowed to make a living online where he would have an impressionable and potentially vulnerable audience.  But regardless of the law being inherently black and white there are varying degrees of immorality, and I think that pretending that what he did was just as reprehensible as it would be to SA an actual child is just as harmful to the debate as it is to pretend that he did nothing wrong whatsoever.", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "@thexbigxgreen", "channel": "UCwYKABSmQBHYeiT9sCgCx2w", "votes": "7", "replies": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_nGpy0hby6CppNHEiJ3XNuraR55gsxgQ24rD1I7tGc=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1762208844.311423}
