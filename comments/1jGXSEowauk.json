Heterosexual traditions are practically hard-coded into culture, and demand men make the first move. And it's not like this is an explicit rule, women could make the first move, but what's also hard-coded is that a woman making the first move signifies a failure on the guy's part, which intrinsically makes it a big no-no. Guys however are secretly desperate to be in that situation, and would gladly accept, it's just that many women would rather die of old age than endure the embarrassment of having to ask a guy on a date because he's too oblivious to do it first. It's made even less likely because, as the subject of male pursuit, women don't need to look far to find a guy who will. So she'd have to go way out of her way to break that mold.

I'm not.\" I said, \"okay?

She walked me to my next class and talked at me the whole way. This lasted about 2 weeks before my patience wore thin and I finally asked, \"girl, why are you stalking me?!\" She was like, \"😳 I'm not stalking you!\" And then she finally left me alone until my choir xmas concert.
