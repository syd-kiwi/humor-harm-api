Well Jim, listen to my thought process. My whole idea for the gun is I'm gonna use the gun more so like as a deterrent.

My writing process is simple. I do not sit and write out jokes. I am really bad at that. Ask the Oscars. I experience things and then I come out on stage and I share them and sometimes people laugh and if they laugh, that's cool. I keep that and whatever doesn't get a laugh, I work on until it gets, you know, ah-ha-ha. 15 plus years ago, my friend Ivan, who is one of my, he's my number one longest, oldest employee, not old like he's like, hello, how are you? He's just, he's been around a long time. He's been there from day one. Ivan's original job was to record my shows using a camcorder. Now the fact that I'm saying camcorder should be an indication of the timeline because I know some of you right now are like, what's a camcorder? Yeah, so it was a Snapchat of our day. So Ivan would record the shows and then put away the camcorder and the tripod and a bunch of tapes into a bag. It was very bulky. It wasn't a phone, it was bulky. And then we go back to the hotel and then he'd break the little guard off the back of the TV and then, you know, he'd hook it up and we watch the thing and that's how I would review my material. One night we go to dinner. Ivan packed up the bag. We met, you know, we met in the hotel lobby and Ivan forgot the camera bag in the hotel lobby and we went to dinner. And when we came back, it was gone. And we never recovered the tape. And I know some of you are like, how convenient. The tape of him getting naked is gone.

Every day is like waking up to Christmas and we just get so many blessings under President Trump and his administration, his meeting cabinet picks. This is a fantastic time to be alive. And Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. Well President Trump has just now been well established. Is the greatest negotiator, the greatest deal maker, the greatest diplomat, and the greatest peacemaker that we have ever seen in this country. Well it was a very tough decision. All the nominees delivered extraordinary tongue work this week but only one can win. And the Golden Graveler goes to... LARLA TRUMP LARLA TRUMP LARA TRUMP Congratulations LARA. You are the bootlicking brown nose, suck up sycophant, apple-polishing, gonad-guzzling ass kisser of the week. And the rescue haters just need to try harder, that's all.","2026-02-12T18:34:13.603301Z","s3://humor-harm-dataset/dataset-s3/xTmRY5L7wT0.mp4"

Why, Zach? I brought my wife, then fiance's family, on a trip to Mexico. There's like this really touristy beach that you can only access via boats. They've got like water slide and zipline and you lounge on the beach and hammocks over the water. The boat this time, for whatever reason, was leaving from a military port. And so as we're all getting in line to go on the boat, we're going through metal detectors. I'm like, that's stupid. We're going, why? Why? I forgot that I always have a little weed pen or CBD pen on me. This one was specifically my CBD pen for chronic pain. I honestly didn't even realize I had brought it to Mexico. It was just in the bottom of my backpack stored away. They pull it out and it's got a little THC on it. It helps the uploading of this CBD. It helps my brain upload. I'm f***ed. And Maggie's mom, she's like trying to talk to them in Spanish, being like, it's a misunderstanding. And I'm like, you guys got to get the f*** out of here. Just go. They told me I was very lucky because had this been like two years ago, this would have been a fang. But the result of this was just, you're not getting on this boat today. The whole family's on this boat going to this island without me. I'm picturing my wife taking her engagement ring off. Like I've embarrassed her in front of her family. A pop smoker. Smuggling f***s into a foreign country. A guy brings me to the side and he goes, there is another way. Wow, you're in a movie now. He draws me a map. He says, you're going to charter a taxi. Take it to the last town on the road. You're going to charter a water taxi. Take a boat to this island. Get another boat on that island. They will drop you in Las Caletas. So I now have, I had video of this. Oh my God, yes. Shit. The Goonies. I take this map and I am ripping it. I am like, dude, you got to get me there because if I do not get to this island, she's going to break up with me. Meanwhile, the boat ride that they went on, again, the most touristy thing ever. They have dudes doing like a kiss impression. They're dancing to Katy Perry. It's a nightmare. Have you guys ever like gobbled all of your gummies before a thing like that? Because you're like, uh-oh. Someone's going to check. Singapore. Go to Singapore. I always put my gummies in a vitamin gummy thing. Of course.

You must understand that when the Labour Party want people to believe that they tough on immigration, their actions do not complement their rhetoric. So you must understand that, surely? So record deportations, that doesn't matter for anything. Record deportations are the majority of which are voluntary. Who cares? They're going. The point is we have to move them. I care. If I'm paying some random guy that was illegally here in the first place to go home, I don't appreciate this current government gaslighting people and making out that they are so tough on immigration that they have deported this fella. No, they have not. They've paid the fella and wanted to go back anywhere. Good news to me.","2026-01-15T21:57:25.758300Z","s3://humor-harm-dataset/dataset-s3/-rCfnCQ1sRA.mp4"

At the same time, when you have networks that where I won an election, like in counties, I guess it's 2,600 to 525. It's called landslide, landslide times two, but 97, 94, 95, 96% of the people are against me in the sense of the newscasts are against me. The stories are 90, they said 97% bad. You see what we have here, people? 2,600 counties, minus 525 counties divided by negative 97. I think you see what this all adds up to. See, I think that's really illegal personally. Boom! Let me explain something. Free speech has always been a ratio. If the county vote were more equal, you could take a good story and make it bad without being jailed. But as our founders stated in the Constitution, when the delta between the sigma of counties divided by factorials of negativity are greater than pi, your inalienable rights turn into more of a expired groupon.","2026-01-27T23:11:59.632721Z","s3://humor-harm-dataset/dataset-s3/0qOZ6XTklPc.mp4"

For several days in July, these two kingdoms in Southeast Asia engaged in deadly fighting. The Thai and Cambodian militaries battled each other across stretches of their long, contested border, killing dozens and displacing some 200,000 people. Cambodia fired rockets while a tie of 16s carried out airstrikes. It was the worst violence between these two countries in generations. In late July, a lull in the fighting, after Trump declared, amid threats of imposing high tariffs, that Cambodia and Thailand agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a ceasefire and ultimately peace. The next day, with the help of U.S. mediation, Cambodia's Prime Minister met his Thai counterpart in Malaysia to agree to a temporary ceasefire. Sunday's signing ceremony in Kuala Lumpur builds on those initial peace gains and marks a diplomatic victory for Trump and his often stated commitment to conflict resolution.","2026-02-02T17:22:00.817339Z","s3://humor-harm-dataset/dataset-s3/2rydwTQYIFU.mp4"

So she basically said that her and Ethan were friends, and when they'd hang out, they eventually started hooking up. No guy ever had this type of hold on her. Like, all she thought about was him. But really, let's be honest, like Grayson Dolan was the better Dolan twin, in my opinion, but they kept it super casual. Then one day, Ethan is like, I want to be exclusive with you. And she's like, oh my goodness, this is so exciting. Then she doesn't hear from him the next day, and like, for a few weeks, he's like dodging her calls and stuff.
