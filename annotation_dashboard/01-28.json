Can we get a dog? My parents had to sit through years of that until my dad finally couldn't handle it anymore and got me one for my seventh birthday against my mom's will. Before that, they tried everything to make me stop, besides getting me a dog. And by everything, I mean a bunch of fish. Maybe if we shape these fish into a dog, she won't notice. They'd come home with two fish from the pet store that would last for about a week, die, and then get replaced. Repeat until dog appears. How many fish must die before I get what I want? Since we got fish from the pet store and not an actual breeder, that was probably a big contributing factor on why they died so quickly.

My writing process is simple. I do not sit and write out jokes. I am really bad at that. Ask the Oscars. I experience things and then I come out on stage and I share them and sometimes people laugh and if they laugh, that's cool. I keep that and whatever doesn't get a laugh, I work on until it gets, you know, ah-ha-ha. 15 plus years ago, my friend Ivan, who is one of my, he's my number one longest, oldest employee, not old like he's like, hello, how are you? He's just, he's been around a long time. He's been there from day one. Ivan's original job was to record my shows using a camcorder. Now the fact that I'm saying camcorder should be an indication of the timeline because I know some of you right now are like, what's a camcorder? Yeah, so it was a Snapchat of our day. So Ivan would record the shows and then put away the camcorder and the tripod and a bunch of tapes into a bag. It was very bulky. It wasn't a phone, it was bulky. And then we go back to the hotel and then he'd break the little guard off the back of the TV and then, you know, he'd hook it up and we watch the thing and that's how I would review my material. One night we go to dinner. Ivan packed up the bag. We met, you know, we met in the hotel lobby and Ivan forgot the camera bag in the hotel lobby and we went to dinner. And when we came back, it was gone. And we never recovered the tape. And I know some of you are like, how convenient. The tape of him getting naked is gone. And to you I say, why would I even make up such a story that could potentially hurt my credibility or my image? I don't need five minutes of ha-ha. What I need is there to not be a tape. I know that there's footage out there of me doing something really, really embarrassing and something I wish I could take back. And I know that when this Netflix special airs, a lot of people are going to see it. And hopefully the person who has the footage is watching. And I would like to tell that person right now in your living room, I know you have the tape. I have $50,000 with your name on.

Why, Zach? I brought my wife, then fiance's family, on a trip to Mexico. There's like this really touristy beach that you can only access via boats. They've got like water slide and zipline and you lounge on the beach and hammocks over the water. The boat this time, for whatever reason, was leaving from a military port. And so as we're all getting in line to go on the boat, we're going through metal detectors. I'm like, that's stupid. We're going, why? Why? I forgot that I always have a little weed pen or CBD pen on me. This one was specifically my CBD pen for chronic pain. I honestly didn't even realize I had brought it to Mexico. It was just in the bottom of my backpack stored away. They pull it out and it's got a little THC on it. It helps the uploading of this CBD. It helps my brain upload. I'm f***ed. And Maggie's mom, she's like trying to talk to them in Spanish, being like, it's a misunderstanding. And I'm like, you guys got to get the f*** out of here. Just go. They told me I was very lucky because had this been like two years ago, this would have been a fang. But the result of this was just, you're not getting on this boat today. The whole family's on this boat going to this island without me. I'm picturing my wife taking her engagement ring off. Like I've embarrassed her in front of her family. A pop smoker. Smuggling f***s into a foreign country. A guy brings me to the side and he goes, there is another way. Wow, you're in a movie now. He draws me a map. He says, you're going to charter a taxi. Take it to the last town on the road. You're going to charter a water taxi. Take a boat to this island. Get another boat on that island. They will drop you in Las Caletas. So I now have, I had video of this. Oh my God, yes. Shit. The Goonies. I take this map and I am ripping it. I am like, dude, you got to get me there because if I do not get to this island, she's going to break up with me. Meanwhile, the boat ride that they went on, again, the most touristy thing ever. They have dudes doing like a kiss impression. They're dancing to Katy Perry. It's a nightmare. Have you guys ever like gobbled all of your gummies before a thing like that? Because you're like, uh-oh. Someone's going to check. Singapore. Go to Singapore. I always put my gummies in a vitamin gummy thing. Of course. Just take them out of the wrapping, put them in a vitamin gummy bottle. I got scared. It's been too long. I literally at all times have a sour patch. Empty. Empty sour patch? Just in case and you put your d*** in there. They look nothing like sour patch kits. Yeah, they don't know."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2026-01-13T18:33:36.865101Z","updated_at":"2026-01-15T21:48:45.391510Z","inner_id":71,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":718,"annotations":[{"id":108,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Not Humor"]},"id":"FHHo2uy6Aj","from_name":"humor_presence","to_name":"video","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Other"]},"id":"Qi73pd1Go7","from_name":"joke_topic","to_name":"video","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["None of these"]},"id":"YWTb9tAnDg","from_name":"rhetorical_device","to_name":"video","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["None of these"]},"id":"xdwBDkvjdH","from_name":"humor_type","to_name":"video","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2026-01-15T21:49:06.382183Z","updated_at":"2026-01-15T21:49:06.382206Z","draft_created_at":"2026-01-15T21:49:04.424100Z","lead_time":19.149,"prediction":{},"result_count":4,"unique_id":"a5c258e5-3f25-4309-afa5-04113c947b8c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":718,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"video":"s3:\/\/humor-harm-dataset\/dataset-s3\/-jI-zsqAoGc.mp4","transcript_text":"Baila mg dan"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2026-01-13T18:33:36.878967Z","updated_at":"2026-01-15T21:49:06.440012Z","inner_id":72,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":719,"annotations":[{"id":109,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Humor"]},"id":"k0Y9dQ9seP","from_name":"humor_presence","to_name":"video","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Relationships"]},"id":"NFCeL3GkEQ","from_name":"joke_topic","to_name":"video","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["None of these"]},"id":"IKrbL_EvS_","from_name":"rhetorical_device","to_name":"video","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Regular Humor"]},"id":"FBg8RMucTI","from_name":"humor_type","to_name":"video","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2026-01-15T21:50:19.460852Z","updated_at":"2026-01-15T21:50:19.460874Z","draft_created_at":"2026-01-15T21:49:19.846772Z","lead_time":70.848,"prediction":{},"result_count":4,"unique_id":"5ac6d53d-5426-4db6-922a-2c421501f035","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":719,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"video":"s3:\/\/humor-harm-dataset\/dataset-s3\/-lUFpw6dXIY.mp4","transcript_text":"What would you consider a red flag, like wind-dating?

So I would gaslight you into you thinking you're the problem, and then I would abuse you emotionally to you get to a point where you only get satisfaction from me and if I tell you you look good or anything like that. And then I would start slightly treating you better so you'd think I'm changing. And then it would be this off and on until you're almost hooked for life and I'm almost like a drug to you. Where even when you're not around me and we break up, like you're yearning for me like nicotine. And if that doesn't work, I'd go to a movie. If I'll ask them, a movie. Okay.
